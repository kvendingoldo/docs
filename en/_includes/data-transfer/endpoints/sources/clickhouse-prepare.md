If transferring tables with engines other than `ReplicatedMergeTree` and `Distributed` in a {{ CH }} multi-host cluster, the transfer will fail with the following error: `the following tables have not Distributed or Replicated engines and are not yet supported`.

    1. Make sure the tables you are transferring use the `MergeTree` family engines. Only these tables and [materialized views]({{ ch.docs }}/engines/table-engines/special/materializedview/) (MaterializedView) will be transferred.

       In case of a multi-host cluster, only tables and materialized views with the `ReplicatedMergeTree` or `Distributed` engines will be transferred. Make sure these tables and views are present on all the cluster hosts.
