If a custom [log group](../../logging/concepts/log-group.md) is not specified in the function version parameters or logging is not turned off, the function automatically writes all [logs](../../functions/concepts/logs.md) to the default log group for the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) it resides in.
