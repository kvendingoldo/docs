# Gateway resource fields


The `Gateway` resource defines the rules for accepting and routing ([HTTPRoute](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/http-route.md) and [TLSRoute](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/tls-route.md) resources) incoming traffic. [{{ alb-name }} Gateway API](../../../application-load-balancer/tools/k8s-gateway-api/index.md) uses these rules to create:

* [Load balancer](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/application-load-balancer.md) with the required listeners.
* [Backend groups](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md).
* [HTTP routers](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/http-router.md) (if the [HTTPRoute](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/http-route.md) resources are used).

`Gateway` is designed for cluster operators. Application developers should use `TLSRoute` or `HTTPRoute`.

`Gateway` is a {{ k8s }} resource specified by the [{{ k8s }} Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) project. Below, you can find the descriptions of the resource fields and annotations {{ alb-name }} Gateway API interfaces with. For a full description of the resource configuration, see the [{{ k8s }} Gateway API documentation](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2.Gateway).

## Gateway {#gateway}

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: <string>
  namespace: <string>
  annotations:
    gateway.alb.yc.io/security-groups: <string>
spec: <GatewaySpec>
```

Where:

* `apiVersion`: `gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2`
* `kind`: `Gateway`
* `metadata` (`ObjectMeta`, required)

   Resource metadata.

   * `name` (`string`, required)

      Resource name. For more information about the format, please see the [{{ k8s }} documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).

      This name is not the balancer name in {{ alb-name }}.

   * `namespace` (`string`)

      [Namespace](../../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#namespace) the resource belongs to. The default value is `default`.

   * `annotations` (`map[string]string`, required)

      Resource annotation.

      * `gateway.alb.yc.io/security-groups` (`string`, required)

         List of {{ vpc-name }} [security groups](../../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) for a load balancer. Group IDs are provided in a comma-separated list, e.g.:

         ```
         gateway.alb.yc.io/security-groups: b0c2kotoidcoh6haf8cu,e2lnhhdj9a0aqmr78d36,e9bud5itjnl8mkjj7td1
         ```

         For the proper load balancer and Gateway API operation, security groups must be configured as specified in [{#T}](../../../application-load-balancer/tools/k8s-ingress-controller/security-groups.md).

* `spec` (`GatewaySpec`, required)

   Resource specification. For more information, see [below](#spec).


## GatewaySpec {#spec}

```yaml
gatewayClassName: yc-df-class
listeners:
  - name: <string>
    hostname: <string>
    port: <int32>
    protocol: <string>
    tls:
      mode: <string>
      certificateRefs:
        - group: <string>
          kind: <string>
          name: <string>
          namespace: <string>
        - ...
    allowedRoutes:
      namespaces:
        from: <string>
        selector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: <string>
              operator: <string>
              values:
                - <string>
                - ...
          matchLabels:
            <string>: <string>
            ...
  - ...
addresses:
  - type: IPAddress
    value: <string>
  - ...
```

Where:

* `gatewayClassName`: `yc-df-class`
* `listeners` (`[]Listener`)

   Load balancer listeners.

   * `name` (`string`)

      Internal name of the listener.

      This name only serves the {{ k8s }} needs and is not the listener name in {{ alb-name }}.

      A name should have the domain format, i.e., correspond to the following regular expression:

      ```[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?(\.[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9]*[a-z0-9])?)*```

      For instance, such names as `example`, `example.com`, or `foo.example.com` are suitable, while `example.com/bar` and `-example.` are not.

      The name may be up to 63 characters long.

   * `hostname` (`string`)

      Domain name that the listener is enabled for.

      {% include [k8s-ingress-controller-hostnames-wildcard](../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ingress-controller-hostnames-wildcard.md) %}

      Only the routes ([HTTPRoute](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/http-route.md) and [TLSRoute](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/tls-route.md) resources) whose domain names (`spec.hostnames` field) <q>overlap</q> with the domain name specified in this field will be linked to the listener.

   * `port` (`int32`)

      Port the listener uses for incoming traffic.

   * `protocol` (`string`)

      Protocol the listener uses for incoming traffic: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, or `TLS`.

   * `tls` (`GatewayTlsConfig`)

      TLS settings used for incoming HTTPS or TLS traffic.

      * `mode` (`string`)

         Mode for terminating TLS connections.

         The only supported and default value is `Terminate`: connections are terminated using certificates from the `certificateRefs` field, and decrypted traffic is routed to backends. `Passthrough` mode (without connection termination) is not supported.

      * `certificateRefs` (`[]SecretObjectReference`)

         List of {{ k8s }} resources where TLS certificates are stored.

         Only used if the `protocol` field value is `HTTPS` or `TLS`. In which case the list must contain at least one certificate.

         The load balancer only uses the first certificate from the list while ignoring the other ones.

         You can add a certificate to a cluster as a secret (`Secret` resource) using the {{ managed-k8s-name }} management console or kubectl:

         ```
         kubectl create secret tls <secret_name> \
           -n <namespace_name> \
           --cert <path_to_certificate_file> \
           --key <path_to_file_with_certificate_private_key>
         ```

         * `group` (`string`)

            Name of the {{ k8s }} API group that the resource with the certificate belongs to, such as `networking.k8s.io`.

            The default value is an empty line that indicates the root API group.

         * `kind` (`string`)

            Type of the {{ k8s }} resource that stores the certificate.

            The default value is `Secret`.

         * `name` (`string`)

            Name of the {{ k8s }} resource that stores the certificate.

         * `namespace` (`string`)

            Namespace that the name of the resource with the certificate belongs to.

   * `allowedRoutes` (`AllowedRoutes`)

      Rules for selecting routes for the listener ([HTTPRoute](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/http-route.md) and [TLSRoute](../../../application-load-balancer/k8s-ref/tls-route.md) resources). For a route to be selected, the resources must refer to the `Gateway` resource in the `spec.parentRefs` field in their configuration.

      These routes are used to create the [backend groups](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/backend-group.md) you can link to the listener. If using `HTTPRoute`, [HTTP routers](../../../application-load-balancer/concepts/http-router.md) are also created.

      * `namespaces` (`RouteNamespaces`)

         Rule for selecting the namespaces of the `HTTPRoute` and `TLSRoute` resources you can link to the listener.

         * `from` (`string`)

            Rule type:

            * `All`: Resources from all namespaces are selected.
            * `Same`: Resources are only selected from the same namespace as that of the `Gateway` resource (`metadata.namespace` field).
            * `Selector`: Resources are selected from namespaces that meet the requirements from the `selector` field.

         * `selector` (`LabelSelector`)

            A selector is a set of namespace requirements. Only namespaces that meet all the requirements from the `matchExpressions` and `matchLabels` fields are selected.

            For more information, see the [{{ k8s }} API reference](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.23/#labelselector-v1-meta).

            If the `from` field value is different from `Selector`, the `selector` field is ignored.

* `addresses` (`[]GatewayAddress`)

   Load balancer's public IP settings.

   If omitted, the load balancer is automatically assigned one public IP address.

   * `type`: `IPAddress`
   * `value` (`string`)

      {{ vpc-full-name }} public IP assigned to the load balancer.

      Before specifying an IP address in this field, make sure to reserve it by following [this guide](../../../vpc/operations/get-static-ip.md).
