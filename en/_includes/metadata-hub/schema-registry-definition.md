[{{ schema-registry-name }}](../../metadata-hub/concepts/schema-registry.md) implements a schema registry, i.e., a centralized repository for managing and validating [data schemas](../../metadata-hub/concepts/schema-registry.md#schema). The schema registry ensures safe data schema evolution, resolves data compatibility issues, and enhances system performance by reducing the volume of data transmitted over the network. Moreover, the schema registry will allow you to satisfy data security requirements and promote collaboration across teams. In {{ schema-registry-name }}, you can add schemas in [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/), [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/), and [Protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) formats.
