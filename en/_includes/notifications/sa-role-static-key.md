For authentication in {{ cns-name }}, use a [static access key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md). The key is issued for the [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), and all actions are performed on behalf of that service account.

To get a static access key:
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) a service account.
1. [Assign](../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) the service account the `editor` [role](../../iam/roles-reference.md#editor) for the folder.
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md) a static access key for the service account.

   Save the ID and private key.
