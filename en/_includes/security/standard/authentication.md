# 1. Authentication and access management


In {{ yandex-cloud }}, identification, authentication, and access control is performed by [{{ iam-full-name }} ({{ iam-short-name }})](../../../iam/) and [{{ org-full-name }}](../../../organization/).

The platform works with three categories of users:

* [Yandex accounts](../../../iam/concepts/users/accounts.md#passport): Accounts in Yandex ID.
* [Federated accounts](../../../iam/concepts/#saml-federation): Accounts in a corporate [SAML-compatible identity federation](../../../organization/concepts/add-federation.md), such as Active Directory.
* [Service accounts](../../../iam/concepts/#sa): Accounts that can be used by programs to manage resources.

Yandex ID and federated accounts are authenticated in their own systems. {{ yandex-cloud }} has no access to the passwords of these account users and only authenticates service accounts using {{ iam-short-name }}.

User access to cloud resources is regulated by [roles](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md). {{ yandex-cloud }} services may provide different levels of granularity while granting permissions: in some cases, a role can be assigned directly to a service resource, in other cases, permissions are only granted at the level of the folder or cloud where the service resource is located.

This ensures interaction of different categories of resources, roles, and users in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. Access to resources is managed by {{ iam-short-name }}. {{ iam-short-name }} controls each request and makes sure that all operations with resources are only run by users who have the appropriate permissions.

#### 1.1 An identity federation (single sign-on, SSO) is configured {#saml-federation}

[{{ org-full-name }}](../../../organization/) is a single service for managing the organizational structure, setting up integration with the employee catalog, and differentiating user access to the organization's cloud resources.

For the purpose of centralized account management, use [SAML-compatible identity federations](../../../organization/concepts/add-federation.md). By using identity federations, a company can set up Single Sign-On, which is authentication in {{ yandex-cloud }} via their IdP server. With this approach, employees can use their corporate accounts that are subject to the company's security policies, such as:

* Revoking and blocking accounts.
* Password policies.
* Limiting the number of unsuccessful login attempts.
* Blocking access sessions upon expiry of a preset user's idle time.
* Two-factor authentication.

{% note tip %}

Use federated accounts instead of Yandex ID accounts whenever possible. Keep in mind that there is a separate role, `organization-manager.federations.admin`, you can use to manage a federation.

{% endnote %}

To make sure all authentication requests from {{ yandex-cloud }} contain a digital signature, enable the **Sign authentication requests** option. To complete the configuration, download and install a {{ yandex-cloud }} certificate. You can download the certificate in the **Sign authentication requests** field immediately after creating a federation.

* [Guide on configuring a SAML-based federation with KeyCloak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-oe7V9PvC4).

##### 1.1.1 User group mapping is set up in an identity federation {#group-mapping}

In organizations with a lot of users, you may need to grant the same access permissions for {{ yandex-cloud }} resources to multiple users at once. In this case, it is more efficient to grant roles and permissions to a group rather than individually.

If you have configured user groups in your identity provider or plan to do so, [set up user group mapping](../../../organization/operations/federation-group-mapping.md) between the identity provider and {{ org-name }}. Users in the identity provider's groups will be granted the same access permissions to {{ yandex-cloud }} resources as their respective groups in {{ org-name }}.

#### 1.2 Yandex ID accounts are only used in exceptional cases {#yandex-id-accounts}

The best approach to account management, in terms of security, is using identity federations (for more information, see recommendation 1.1). Therefore, you should aim to have only federated users, i.e., users with the <q>FEDERATION ID</q> attribute, in your organization and minimize Yandex ID accounts. The following exceptions are allowed:

* Account with the `billing.accounts.owner` permissions (technically, only a Yandex ID account can have this role at the moment).
* Account with the `organization-manager.organizations.owner` and `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}` permissions, if used in emergencies only, e.g., when configuration of your federation fails. If necessary, you can [delete](../../../security/operations/account-deletion.md) a privileged passport account with the `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role from an organization.
* External accounts, such as those of your contract partners or contractors, which, for some reason, you cannot register in your IdP.

  1. Open the {{ yandex-cloud }} console in your browser.
  1. Go to **All services** → **{{ org-full-name }}** → **Users**.
  1. Make sure the **Federation** column is set to **federation** for all the accounts (the allowed exceptions are listed above). Otherwise, proceed to <q>Guides and solutions to use</q>.

- Performing a check via the CLI {#cli}

  1. See what organizations are available to you and write down the ID you need:

      ```bash
      yc organization-manager organization list
      ```

  1. Run the command below to search for non-federated accounts in your organization, but for the ID of the account included in the list of valid exceptions:

      ```bash
      yc organization-manager user list --organization-id=<organization ID> \
        --format=json | jq -r '.[] | select(.subject_claims.sub!="<ID of account from list of allowed exceptions>")' | jq -r 'select(.subject_claims.federation | not)'
      ```

  1. If there are no accounts in the list, the recommendation is fulfilled. Otherwise, proceed to <q>Guides and solutions to use</q>.

{% endlist %}

**Guides and solutions to use:**

Remove all the accounts that have a Yandex ID from your organization, except those on the list of allowed exceptions.

#### 1.3 Only appropriate administrators can manage {{ iam-short-name }} group membership {#iam-admins}

You can conveniently control access to resources via [user groups](../../../iam/operations/groups/create.md). Make sure to control access to a group as a resource. Users with access permissions for a group can manage other users' membership in that group. Users get these permissions in the following cases:

* User has the `organization-manager.groups.memberAdmin` role for the organization.
* User has the `organization-manager.groups.memberAdmin` role for a specific group as a resource.
* User has the `organization-manager.organizations.owner` or `{{ roles-admin }}` role or another privileged role for the whole organization.
* User has the `{{ roles-admin }}` or `{{ roles-editor }}` role for a specific group as a resource (this is not recommended).

#### 1.4 Service roles are used instead of primitive roles: {{ roles-admin }}, {{ roles-editor }}, {{ roles-viewer }}, and {{ roles-auditor }} {#min-privileges}

The [principle of least privilege](../../../iam/best-practices/using-iam-securely.md#restrict-access) requires assigning users the minimum required roles. We do not recommend using primitive roles, such as `{{ roles-admin }}`, `{{ roles-editor }}`, `{{ roles-viewer }}`, and `{{ roles-auditor }}` that are valid for all services, because this contradicts the principle of least privilege. To ensure more selective access control and implementation of the principle of least privilege, use service roles that only contain permissions for a certain type of resources in a given service. You can see the list of all service roles in the [{{ yandex-cloud }} roll reference](../../../iam/roles-reference.md).

Use the [{{ roles-auditor }}](../../../iam/roles-reference.md#auditor) role without data access wherever possible.

**Guides and solutions to use:**

Analyze the accounts found with the `{{ roles-admin }}`, `{{ roles-editor }}`, and `{{ roles-viewer }}` primitive roles assigned and replace them with [service granular roles](../../../iam/roles-reference.md) based on your role matrix.

#### 1.5 Cloud entities with service accounts are registered and limited {#sa}

A [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) is an account that can be used by a program to manage resources in {{ yandex-cloud }}. A service account is used to make requests as an application.

* Do not use employee accounts instead of service accounts. If, for example, an employee quits or moves to a different department, their account permissions are disabled, which may lead to an application failure.
* Do not write service account keys directly to your application's code, configuration files, or environment variables.

**When using service accounts**:

* [Assign the service account](../../../compute/operations/vm-connect/auth-inside-vm.md) to the VM and get the token via the metadata service.
* Additionally, set up the local firewall on the VM to allow access to the metadata service (IP address: `169.254.169.254`) only to the appropriate processes and system users.

  Example of denying access to all users except the specified one (in this case, `root`):

  ```bash
  sudo iptables --append OUTPUT --proto tcp \
  --destination 169.254.169.254 --match owner ! --uid-owner root \
  --jump REJECT
  ```

The cloud entities with service accounts assigned must be registered and limited, because, for example, if a service account is assigned to a VM, a hacker may get the service account's token from the metadata service from within the VM.

#### 1.6 There are no cloud keys represented as plaintext in the VM metadata service {#cloud-keys}

Do not write service account keys and other keys to the [VM metadata](../../../compute/concepts/vm-metadata.md) directly. [Assign a service account](../../../compute/operations/vm-connect/auth-inside-vm.md) to a VM instance and get a token using the metadata service. You can store sensitive data in any metadata field. However, the most common one is `user-data` (due to its use in the cloud-init utility).

See the list of all regular expressions used to search for cloud accounts' credential secrets:

* **yandex_cloud_iam_cookie_v1** : c1\.[A-Z0-9a-z_-]+[=]{0,2}\.[A-Z0-9a-z_-]{86}[=]{0,2}

#### 1.7 Getting a token via AWS IMDSv1 is disabled on the VM {#aws-token}

The cloud has a [metadata service](../../../compute/concepts/vm-metadata.md) that provides information about VM performance.

From inside a VM, metadata is available in the following formats:

* Google Compute Engine (some fields are not supported).
* Amazon EC2 (some fields are not supported).

Amazon EC2 Instance Metadata Service version 1 (IMDSv1) has a number of drawbacks. The most critical of them is that there is a risk of compromising a service account token via the metadata service using a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack. For more information, see the [official AWS blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/defense-in-depth-open-firewalls-reverse-proxies-ssrf-vulnerabilities-ec2-instance-metadata-service/). Therefore, AWS has released IMDSv2, the second version of the metadata service.

So far, {{ yandex-cloud }} does not support version 2, so it is strongly recommended to technically disable getting a service account token via the Amazon EC2 metadata service.

The Google Compute Engine metadata service uses an additional header to protect against SSRF and enhance security.

You can disable getting a service account token via Amazon EC2 using the [aws_v1_http_token:DISABLED](../../../compute/api-ref/grpc/Instance/create.md#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.MetadataOptions) VM parameter.

[Assign](../../../iam/operations/sa/set-access-bindings.md) roles that allow using and managing service accounts to a minimum number of users.
Each service account with extended permissions should be placed as a resource in a separate folder. It prevents accidental granting of permissions for this account along with the permissions for the folder with the respective service component.

* [IAM tokens](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) that are valid for 12 hours.
* [API keys](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/api-key.md) with unlimited validity.
* [Authorized keys](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/key.md) with unlimited validity.
* [AWS API-compatible static access keys](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md) with unlimited validity.

You need to rotate keys with unlimited validity yourself: delete and generate new ones. You can check out the date when a key was created in its properties. Perform key rotation at least once in 90 days as recommended in the information security standards, such as PCI DSS.

**Guides and solutions to use:**

Follow the [guide](../../../iam/operations/compromised-credentials.md#key-reissue) for rotating keys depending on their type.

#### 1.11 Two-factor authentication is set up for privileged accounts {#twofa}

We recommend using two-factor authentication (2FA) for cloud infrastructure access control to avoid the risk of compromising user accounts. Access to the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console can be based on 2FA.

To enable two-factor authentication, contact an identity provider that supports 2FA and set up a SAML-compliant identity federation. {{ yandex-cloud }} has no IdP of its own and user identification is done using external services, such as Yandex ID or corporate systems integrated via identity federations. For example, if you are using an IdP of Active Directory or Keycloak, set up 2FA in these systems. Make sure to set up 2FA at least for privileged cloud accounts.

For a Yandex ID, set up 2FA using [this guide](https://yandex.com/support/id/authorization/twofa.html).

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Performing a check in the management console {#console}

  1. Open the Yandex ID UI in your browser.
  1. Go to the [Security](https://id.yandex.ru/security) tab.
  1. Make sure login with an additional key is selected as the login option.
  1. You should have key-based login configured. Otherwise, proceed to <q>Guides and solutions to use</q>.
  1. If you are using external IdPs, follow the guides to check the settings.

{% endlist %}

**Guides and solutions to use:**

* [Two-factor authentication: Yandex ID](https://yandex.com/support/id/authorization/twofa.html)
* [KeyCloak: Creating other credentials](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#creating-other-credentials)
* [Configure Additional Authentication Methods for AD FS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/configure-additional-authentication-methods-for-ad-fs).

#### 1.12 Privileged roles are only granted to trusted administrators {#privileged-users}

{{ yandex-cloud }} privileged users include accounts with the following roles:

* `billing.accounts.owner`
* `{{ roles-admin }}` assigned for a billing account
* `organization-manager.organizations.owner`
* `organization-manager.admin`
* `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}`
* `{{ roles-admin }}` and `{{ roles-editor }}` assigned for an organization
* `{{ roles-admin }}` and `{{ roles-editor }}` assigned for a cloud
* `{{ roles-admin }}` and `{{ roles-editor }}` assigned for a folder

The `billing.accounts.owner` role is granted automatically when creating a billing account and cannot be reassigned to another user. The role allows you to perform any action with the billing account.

The `billing.accounts.owner` role can only be assigned to a Yandex ID account. An account with the `billing.accounts.owner` role is used when setting up payment methods and adding clouds.

Make sure to properly secure this account: it offers significant privileges and cannot be federated with a corporate account.

The most appropriate approach would be to not use this account on a regular basis:

* Only use it for initial setup and updates.
* When actively using this account, enable two-factor authentication (2FA) in Yandex ID.
* After that, if you do not use the bank card payment method (only available for this role), set a strong password for this account (generated using specialized software), disable 2FA, and refrain from using this account unnecessarily.
* Change the password to a newly generated one each time you use the account.

We recommend disabling 2FA only for this account provided it is not <q>assigned</q> to a specific employee. Thus you can avoid linking this critical account to a personal device.

To manage a billing account, assign the `{{ roles-admin }}` or `{{ roles-editor }}` role for the billing account to a dedicated employee with a federated account.

To view billing data, assign the `{{ roles-viewer }}` role for the billing account to a dedicated employee with a federated account.

By default, the `organization-manager.organizations.owner` role is granted to the user who creates an organization: the organization owner. The role allows you to appoint organization owners and use all the administrator privileges.

The `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}` role is assigned automatically when you create your first cloud in the organization. A user with this role can perform any operation with the cloud or its resources and grant cloud access to other users: assign roles and revoke them.

Assign the `{{ roles-cloud-owner }}` and `organization-manager.organizations.owner` roles to one or more employees with a federated account. Set a strong password for the Yandex ID account that was used to create the cloud, and use it only when absolutely necessary (for example, if the federated access fails).

Make sure to fully protect your federated account that is granted one of the privileged roles listed above:

* Enable two-factor authentication.
* Disable authentication from devices beyond the company's control.
* Configure login attempt monitoring and set alert thresholds.

Assign federated accounts the `{{ roles-admin }}` roles for clouds, folders, and billing accounts. Minimize the number of accounts with these roles and regularly review the expedience of these roles for the accounts they are assigned to.

#### 1.13 Strong passwords are set for local users of managed DBs {#mdb-auth}

To use a database at the application level, in addition to {{ iam-short-name }} service roles, a separate local user is created: the database owner. The following password policy applies to this user:

* The password must include numbers, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.
* It must be at least 8 characters long.

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Manual check {#manual}

  Make sure the password is regularly rotated in manual mode and meets your company password policies. The password is stored on the client side and cannot be viewed in the management console, CLI, and API.

{% endlist %}

#### 1.14 Contractor and third-party access control is enabled {#contractors}

If you grant third-party contractors access to your clouds, make sure to follow these security measures:

* Assign permissions to contractor employees based on the principle of least privilege.
* Where possible, create a separate account for third-party employees in your corporate IdP and assign the relevant policies to this account.
* Require them to handle their account secrets with care.
* Review the relevance of external user access to your cloud infrastructure.
* Use the [{{ roles-auditor }}](../../../iam/roles-reference.md#auditor) role without data access wherever possible.

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Manual check {#manual}

  Check all accounts in your organization and make sure you are aware of all contractor and third-party accounts and follow the recommendations above.

{% endlist %}

#### 1.15 The proper resource model is used {#resourses}

When developing an access model for your infrastructure, we recommend the following approach:

* At least one organization per company.
* Group resources by purpose and store them in separate folders. To ensure the strictest isolation, place them in a separate cloud.
* Place any critical resources in a separate folder or cloud. These include resources related to the processing of payment data, personal data, and trade secret data.
* Host the resource groups that require different administrative permissions in different folders or clouds (DMZ, CDE, security, backoffice, and so on).
* When developing apps, make sure to isolate test and production environments.
* Put shared resources (e.g., network and security groups) into a separate shared resource folder (if you separate components into folders).

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Manual check {#manual}

  Analyze your resource model and make sure it follows the recommendations given above.

{% endlist %}

#### 1.16 There is no <q>public access</q> to your organization resources {#public-access}

{{ yandex-cloud }} allows you to grant public access to your resources. You can grant public access by assigning access permissions to [public groups](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/public-group.md) (`All authenticated users`, `All users`).

Public group details:

* `All authenticated users`: All authenticated users. These are all registered users or {{ yandex-cloud }} service accounts: both from your clouds and other users' clouds.
* `All users`: Any user. No authentication is required.

{% note warning %}

Now `All users` is only supported in the following services: {{ objstorage-short-name }} (if ACL-based access management is used), {{ container-registry-name }}, and {{ sf-name }}. For other services, assigning a role to the `All users` group is equivalent to assigning a role to `All authenticated users`.

{% endnote %}

Make sure that these groups have no public access to your resources: clouds, folder, buckets, and more.

#### 1.17 Contact information of the person in charge of an organization is valid {#org-contacts}

When registering a cloud in {{ yandex-cloud }}, customers enter their contact information. For example, an email address is used for notifications about incidents, scheduled maintenance activities, and so on.

For instance, if abnormal activities in the customer's organization are detected on the cloud side or the {{ iam-short-name }} cloud keys get available in external GitHub repositories, the customer receives a notification. This feature is implemented thanks to {{ yandex-cloud }} participating in the [Github Secret scanning partner program](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/secret-scanning-partner-program) and analyzing secrets in Yandex search. If any keys are compromised in a public repository, delete the secret from the repository and its [history](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository), as well as revoke the [keys](../../../iam/operations/compromised-credentials.md).

#### 1.23 The {{ roles-auditor }} role is used to prevent access to user data {#roles-auditor}

Assign the `{{ roles-auditor }}` role to users who do not need access to data, e.g., external contractors or auditors.
`{{ roles-auditor }}` is a role with least privilege without access to service data. It grants permission to read service configurations and metadata.
The `{{ roles-auditor }}` role allows you to perform the following operations:

* View information about a resource.
* View resource metadata.
* View a list of operations with a resource.

To control access more selectively and implement the principle of least privilege, use the `{{ roles-auditor }}` role by default.
