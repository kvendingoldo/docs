The cost is calculated as follows:

* Number of prompt and response tokens: 1,020 + 30 = 1,050
* Price per 1,000 tokens for the model fine-tuned in {{ ml-platform-name }}, synchronous mode: $0.0096
* Number of units per token for the model fine-tuned in {{ ml-platform-name }}, synchronous mode: 6
* Total number of units in usage details: 1,050 × 6 = 6,300

Total: ($0.0016 / 1,000 units) × 6,300 units = $0.01008 **or** ($0.0096 / 1,000 tokens) × 1,050 tokens = $0.01008
