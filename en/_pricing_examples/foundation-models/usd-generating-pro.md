The cost is calculated as follows:

* Number of prompt and response tokens: 115 + 1,500 = 1,615
* Price per 1,000 tokens for the {{ gpt-pro }} model, asynchronous mode: $0.0048
* Number of units per token for the {{ gpt-pro }} model, asynchronous mode: 3
* Total number of units in usage details: 1,615 × 3 = 4,845

Total: ($0.0048 / 1,000 tokens) × 1,615 tokens = $0.007752
