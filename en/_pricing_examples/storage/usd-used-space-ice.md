For example, if the price per 1 GB of data in ice storage per month is $0.004280, and a 3 GB object was in ice storage from January 1 through September 20 (8 months and 20 days), your storage charge will be calculated as follows:

> Total from January 1 through September 20
>
> : _A_ = 3 × (8 + (20 / 30)) × $0.004280 = (3 × 260 / 30) × $0.004280 = $0.111280
>
> September 20 after deleting the object
>
> : _B_ = (3 × 12 × $0.004280) − _A_ = $0.154080 − $0.111280= = $0.042800
>
> Total
>
> : _A_ + _B_ = $0.154080
