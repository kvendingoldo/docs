* Edit the relevant collection and all its nested collections and workbooks, as well as create copies of it.
* Move and delete the relevant collection and all its nested collections and workbooks.
* Create new collections and workbooks within the relevant collection.
* View and edit all nested [objects](../../../datalens/concepts/index.md#component-interrelation) of the workbooks related to the appropriate collection and its nested collections.
