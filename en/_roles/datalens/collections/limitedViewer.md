You can assign the `datalens.collections.limitedViewer` role to a collection. It allows you to view the info on it and its nested collections and workbooks, which includes viewing charts and dashboards of the nested workbook workbooks. In the DataLens UI, this role is referred to as `Limited viewer`.

Users with this role can:
* View info on the relevant collection and its nested [workbooks and collections](../../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md).
* View info on the [access permissions](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md) granted for the appropriate collection, as well as for its nested collections and workbooks.
* View [charts](../../../datalens/concepts/chart/index.md) and [dashboards](../../../datalens/concepts/dashboard.md) nested into the workbooks related to the appropriate collection and its nested collections.

This role also includes the `datalens.workbooks.limitedViewer` permissions.
