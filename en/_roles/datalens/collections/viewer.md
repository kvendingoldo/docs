You can assign the `datalens.collections.viewer` role to a collection. It allows you to view the info on it and its nested collections and workbooks, as well as view all nested workbook objects. In the DataLens UI, this role is referred to as `Viewer`.

Users with this role can:
* View info on the relevant collection and its nested [workbooks and collections](../../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md).
* View info on the [access permissions](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md) granted for the appropriate collection, as well as for its nested collections and workbooks.
* View all nested [objects](../../../datalens/concepts/index.md#component-interrelation) of the workbooks related to the appropriate collection and its nested collections.

This role also includes the `datalens.collections.limitedViewer` and `datalens.workbooks.viewer` permissions.
