You can assign the `datalens.workbooks.admin` role to a workbook. With it, you can manage the relevant workbook and access to it, as well as all its nested objects. In the DataLens UI, this role is referred to as `Admin`.

Users with this role can:
* View info on the [access permissions](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md) granted for the relevant [workbook](../../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md) and modify such permissions.
* Edit, move, create copies of, and delete the relevant workbook.
* View and edit all workbook's nested [objects](../../../datalens/concepts/index.md#component-interrelation).
* [Embed](../../../datalens/security/private-embedded-objects.md) the workbook's nested private objects to websites and apps.
* [Publish](../../../datalens/concepts/datalens-public.md#how-to-publish) the workbook's nested objects.

This role also includes the `datalens.workbooks.editor` permissions.
