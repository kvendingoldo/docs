You can assign the `datalens.workbooks.editor` role to a workbook. With it, you can edit both the workbook and all its nested objects. In the DataLens UI, this role is referred to as `Editor`.

Users with this role can:
* Edit the relevant [workbook](../../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md) and create copies of it.
* View and edit all workbook's nested [objects](../../../datalens/concepts/index.md#component-interrelation).
* View info on the [access permissions](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md) granted for the workbook.

This role also includes the `datalens.workbooks.viewer` permissions.
