You can assign the `datalens.workbooks.limitedViewer` role to a [workbook](../../../datalens/workbooks-collections/index.md). With it, you can view all workbook's nested [charts](../../../datalens/concepts/chart/index.md) and [dashboards](../../../datalens/concepts/dashboard.md) and the info on the [access permissions](../../../iam/concepts/access-control/index.md) granted for such a workbook. In the DataLens UI, this role is referred to as `Limited viewer`.
