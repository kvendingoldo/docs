Make sure the selected [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) has a [cloud network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) with a [subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet) in at least one [availability zone](../../overview/concepts/geo-scope.md). To do this, select **{{ vpc-short-name }}** on the folder page. If the list contains a network, click its name to see the list of subnets. If the subnets or network you need are not listed, [create them](../../vpc/quickstart.md).
