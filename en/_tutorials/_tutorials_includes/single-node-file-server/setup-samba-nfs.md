After the `fileserver-tutorial` VM's status changes to `RUNNING`, do the following:

1. On the VM page of the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), under **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.instance.overview.section_network }}**, find the VM's public IP address.

1. [Connect](../../../compute/operations/vm-connect/ssh.md) to the VM over SSH.

   The recommended authentication method when connecting over SSH is using a key pair. Make sure to set up the created key pair so that the private key matches the public key sent to the VM.

1. Configure Samba and NFS:

   {% list tabs group=operating_system %}

   - Ubuntu {#ubuntu}

      1. Download and install Samba:

         ```bash
         sudo apt-get update
         sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server samba
         ```

      1. Prepare and mount the file system on the disk:

         ```bash
         sudo mkfs -t ext4 -L data /dev/vdb
         ```

      1. Prepare and mount the folder for data storage on the disk:

         ```bash
         sudo mkdir /<folder_name>
         echo "LABEL=data /<folder_name> ext4 defaults 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
         sudo mount /<folder_name>
         ```

      1. Set the NFS configuration in the `/etc/exports` file. You can edit the file using the `nano` utility:

         ```bash
         sudo nano /etc/exports
         ```

         Add the following lines to the file:

         ```bash
         /<folder_name> <IP_address>(rw,no_subtree_check,fsid=100)
         /<folder_name> 127.0.0.1(rw,no_subtree_check,fsid=100)
         ```

         Where `<IP_address>` is the IP address of the computer you are going to connect the network data disk to via NFS.

      1. Set the Samba configuration in the `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file. You can edit the file using the `nano` utility:

         ```bash
         sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
         ```

         Edit the file as follows:

         ```bash
         [global]
            workgroup = WORKGROUP
            server string = %h server (Samba)
            dns proxy = no
            log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
            max log size = 1000
            syslog = 0
            panic action = /usr/share/samba/panic-action %d
            server role = standalone server
            passdb backend = tdbsam
            obey pam restrictions = yes
            unix password sync = yes
            passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
            passwd chat = *Enter\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *Retype\snew\s*\spassword:* %n\n *password\supdated\ssuccessfully* .
            pam password change = yes
            map to guest = bad user
            usershare allow guests = yes
         [printers]
            comment = All Printers
            browseable = no
            path = /var/spool/samba
            printable = yes
            guest ok = no
            read only = yes
            create mask = 0700
         [print$]
            comment = Printer Drivers
            path = /var/lib/samba/printers
            browseable = yes
            read only = yes
            guest ok = no
         [data]
            comment = /<folder_name>
            path = /<folder_name>
            browseable = yes
            read only = no
            writable = yes
            guest ok = yes
            hosts allow = <IP_address> 127.0.0.1
            hosts deny = 0.0.0.0/0
         ```

         Where `<IP_address>` in the `[data]` section is the IP address of the computer you are going to connect the network data disk to via NFS.

      1. Restart Samba and NFS:

         ```bash
         sudo service nfs-kernel-server restart
         sudo service smbd restart
         ```

   {% endlist %}
