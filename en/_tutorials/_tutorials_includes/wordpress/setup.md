# Creating a website in WordPress


Creating a website based on the [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) CMS is an effective way to quickly launch and manage a web project without in-depth technical knowledge. WordPress is a free and open source system that offers a wide range of templates and themes for creating websites of diverse subjects and structures.

You can create and set up a WordPress-based website using one of these tools:

* [Management console](../../../tutorials/web/wordpress/console.md): Create and customize your WordPress-based website one step at a time from the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console.
* [{{ TF }}](../../../tutorials/web/wordpress/terraform.md): Streamline creating and managing your resources using the _infrastructure as code_ (IaC) approach. Download a {{ TF }} configuration example and then deploy the infrastructure using the [{{ yandex-cloud }} {{ TF }} provider]({{ tf-docs-link }}).
