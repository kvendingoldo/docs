# Creating a WordPress website with a {{ MY }} database cluster

In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a WordPress-based website with a [database cluster](../../managed-mysql/concepts/index.md) managed by {{ MY }} in the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure.

You can create the infrastructure for your WordPress-based website with a {{ MY }} database cluster using one of these tools:
* [Management console](../../tutorials/web/wordpress-mysql/console.md): Create your infrastructure one step at a time from the {{ yandex-cloud }} management console.
* [{{ TF }}](../../tutorials/web/wordpress-mysql/terraform.md): Streamline creating and managing your resources using the _infrastructure as code_ (IaC) approach. Download a {{ TF }} configuration example and then deploy the infrastructure using the [{{ yandex-cloud }} {{ TF }} provider]({{ tf-docs-link }}).
