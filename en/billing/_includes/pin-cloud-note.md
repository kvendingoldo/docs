You can link one or more clouds to your [billing account](../concepts/billing-account.md). Both new and existing clouds can be linked. You cannot unlink a cloud from a billing account. Instead, you can relink it to a different billing account.

If a billing account is added to an [organization](../../billing/concepts/organization.md), you can link clouds from your own organization and those from other organizations you have been [granted access](../../resource-manager/security/index.md) to in {{ billing-name }}.
