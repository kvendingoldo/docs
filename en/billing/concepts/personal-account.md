# Personal account


{% include [non-residents-functional-access](../../_includes/billing/non-residents-functional-access.md) %}


A personal account is your unique {{ billing-name }} ID used to pay for resources throughout the term of your [agreement](contract.md). It holds the money you add to it via your bank card or wire transfer (the method depends on your legal status).

Your personal account money is used only if there are no [grants](bonus-account.md).

## Creating a personal account {#create-ls}

A personal account is created automatically as soon as you [activate the paid version](../operations/activate-commercial.md). This account is virtual and does not have the settlement account or bank account status. It cannot be disabled.

## Personal account number {#id}

You can look up your personal account number [Payment invoice](bill.md).

## Personal account balance {#balance}

Upon activation of the paid version, your personal account balance will be zero by default.

{% include [personal-account-balance](../_includes/personal-account-balance.md) %}

Your balance can go negative due to the [billing threshold](billing-threshold.md) applied after you activate the paid version â€“ and only if paying with a bank card.

We recommend that you [keep track](../operations/pay-the-bill.md) and maintain a positive balance at all times.

If you fail to top up your personal account on time, your use of {{ yandex-cloud }} services may be suspended. Prior to suspension, a payment notice will be sent to the email address specified in your billing account. You will get payment notices seven and three days prior to suspension, as well as on the suspension day. After you top up your personal account, your access to resources will be restored within 24 hours.

## Methods and terms of crediting funds to your personal account {#methods}

The method of crediting funds to your personal account depends on your legal status ([billing account type](../concepts/billing-account.md#ba-types)). How fast the funds will be credited to your personal account depends on the payment method. For more information, see [Payment methods](../payment/index.md).

{% note info %}

You cannot use [grants](bonus-account.md) to top up your personal account.
