# Reporting period

The reporting period is equal to one calendar month during which you are using {{ yandex-cloud }} resources.

At the beginning of each month, you are required to pay for the resources consumed during the previous period. If you are in arrears, your use of {{ yandex-cloud }} resources may be suspended. The [payment method](../payment/index.md) depends on your legal status ([billing account type](billing-account.md#ba-types)).

On the last day of the month, [Yandex Balance](https://balance.yandex.com/) will generate [reporting documents](../payment/documents.md) for businesses and individual entrepreneurs. If there is a bank card linked to your billing account, the system [calculates](../payment/payment-methods-card-business.md#payment-amount) the total amount due and debits it from that card.
