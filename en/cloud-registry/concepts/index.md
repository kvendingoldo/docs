# Overview

{{ cloud-registry-full-name }} is a service for storing and managing development [artifacts](artifacts.md).

You can use {{ cloud-registry-name }} for simple and effective management of artifacts required to create, test, and deploy applications in a cloud environment.

Unlike [{{ container-registry-full-name }}](../../container-registry/concepts/index.md), {{ cloud-registry-full-name }} is optimized to store a broader range of artifacts, including software packages, code libraries, and other files.
