# Registry

_Registry_ is a centralized repository, as well as a management tool for the various files used in app development and deployment.

Each registry contains a set of package versions associated with a particular set of resources. To retrieve and publish packages, you can use a tool like [Maven CLI](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-embedder/cli.html).

Using a registry greatly simplifies the process of managing dependencies between the project components. With a registry, you can quickly access the [artifacts](artifacts.md) you need and manage their versions. This feature will be of use to development teams working on large and complex projects.

Registries share the same data centers with your infrastructure for speedy performance without needless traffic costs.

In a {{ cloud-registry-full-name }} registry, you can manage [Java artifacts](art-java.md).
