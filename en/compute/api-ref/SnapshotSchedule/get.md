A snapshot schedule. For details about the concept, see [documentation](/docs/compute/concepts/snapshot-schedule).

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| id | **string**

ID of the snapshot schedule. ||
|| folderId | **string**

ID of the folder that the snapshot schedule belongs to. ||
|| createdAt | **string** (date-time)

Creation timestamp.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).
In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
|| name | **string**

Name of the snapshot schedule.

The name is unique within the folder. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the snapshot schedule. ||
|| labels | **string**

Snapshot schedule labels as `key:value` pairs. ||
|| status | **enum** (Status)

Status of the snapshot schedule.

- `STATUS_UNSPECIFIED`
- `CREATING`: The snapshot schedule is being created.
- `ACTIVE`: The snapshot schedule is on: new disk snapshots will be created, old ones deleted
(if [SnapshotSchedule.retentionPolicy](/docs/compute/api-ref/SnapshotSchedule/get#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.SnapshotSchedule.retentionPolicy) is specified).
- `INACTIVE`: The schedule is interrupted, snapshots won't be created or deleted.
- `DELETING`: The schedule is being deleted.
- `UPDATING`: Changes are being made to snapshot schedule settings or a list of attached disks. ||
|| schedulePolicy | **[SchedulePolicy](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.SchedulePolicy)**

Frequency settings of the snapshot schedule. ||
|| retentionPeriod | **string** (duration)

Retention period of the snapshot schedule. Once a snapshot created by the schedule reaches this age, it is
automatically deleted.

Includes only one of the fields `retentionPeriod`, `snapshotCount`.

Retention policy of the snapshot schedule. ||
|| snapshotCount | **string** (int64)

Retention count of the snapshot schedule. Once the number of snapshots created by the schedule exceeds this
number, the oldest ones are automatically deleted. E.g. if the number is 5, the first snapshot is deleted
after the sixth one is created, the second is deleted after the seventh one is created, and so on.

Includes only one of the fields `retentionPeriod`, `snapshotCount`.

Retention policy of the snapshot schedule. ||
|| snapshotSpec | **[SnapshotSpec](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.SnapshotSpec)**

Attributes of snapshots created by the snapshot schedule. ||
|#

## SchedulePolicy {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.SchedulePolicy}

A resource for frequency settings of a snapshot schedule.

#|
||Field | Description ||
