# Creating an instance group connected to {{ objstorage-full-name }}


One of the ways to handle [stateful workloads](../../concepts/instance-groups/stateful-workload.md) is saving the application state to an [{{ objstorage-name }} bucket](../../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) independent of the instance group.

To create an instance group that will automatically connect a common {{ objstorage-name }} bucket to each of its instances:

1. {% include [sa.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/sa.md) %}
1. If you do not have an {{ objstorage-name }} bucket, [create one](../../../storage/operations/buckets/create.md).
1. Operations with the bucket are performed under the service account created in the same [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) as the bucket. If there is no such service account, create one. To work with the bucket, assign the `storage.editor` [role](../../../storage/security/index.md#storage-editor) to the service account.

   You can use either one or separate service accounts for working with the instance group and the bucket.

1. Create an instance group:

   {% list tabs group=instructions %}

   - CLI {#cli}

      {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

      {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

      1. View the description of the [CLI](../../../cli/) command to create an instance group:

         ```bash
         {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --help
         ```

      1. Check if there are any [networks](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) in the [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder):

         ```bash
         yc vpc network list
         ```

         If there are none, [create a network](../../../vpc/operations/network-create.md).
      1. Select one of the {{ marketplace-full-name }} public images, e.g., [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/marketplace/products/yc/ubuntu-22-04-lts).

         {% include [standard-images.md](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

      1. Prepare a file with the [YAML specification](../../concepts/instance-groups/specification.md) of the instance group and give it a name, e.g., `specification.yaml`.

         To connect a bucket to instances in the instance group, add the following to the specification:

         * In the `instance_template` field, a nested `service_account_id` field containing the [ID](../../../iam/operations/sa/get-id.md) of the service account with the `storage.editor` role assigned to it:

            ```yml
            instance_template:
              ...
              service_account_id: <service_account_ID>
            ```

            For more granular management of access permissions, attach different service accounts with different permissions to the instance group and VMs in the group.

         * In the `#cloud-config` section of the `instance_template.metadata.user-data` field, commands for mounting the bucket to the instance:

            ```yml
            instance_template:
              ...
              metadata:
                user-data: |-
                  #cloud-config
                  ...
                  runcmd:
                    - apt-get install fuse
                    - wget https://github.com/yandex-cloud/geesefs/releases/latest/download/geesefs-linux-amd64
                    - chmod a+x geesefs-linux-amd64
                    - cp geesefs-linux-amd64 /usr/bin/geesefs
                    - mkdir <VM_mount_point>
                    - echo "user_allow_other" | tee -a /etc/fuse.conf
                    - echo "<bucket_name>    <VM_mount_point>    fuse.geesefs    _netdev,allow_other,--iam    0   0" | tee -a /etc/fstab
                    - mount -a
            ```

            Where:
            * `- apt-get install fuse`: Command for installing [FUSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace); suitable for Ubuntu and Debian. Use the `- yum install fuse` command for operating systems based on Red Hat (such as CentOS and Fedora), `- zypper install fuse`, for OpenSUSE, etc.
            * `<VM_mount_point>`: Directory on the VM to mount the connected bucket to, e.g., `/mnt/gfs0`.
            * `<bucket_name>`: [Name of the bucket](../../../storage/concepts/bucket.md#naming) to connect to the VM.

         This example shows a specification for [creating a fixed-size instance group](./create-fixed-group.md) with an {{ objstorage-name }} bucket connected to the instances.

         For more information about the instance group specification parameters, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/specification.md).

      1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

         ```bash
         {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --file specification.yaml
         ```

         This command creates a group of two similar instances with the following configuration:
         * Name: `my-vm-group-with-object-storage`.
         * OS: `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`.
         * Availability zone: `{{ region-id }}-a`.
         * vCPUs: 2; RAM: 2 GB.
         * Network [HDD](../../concepts/disk.md#disks-types): 32 GB.
         * Connected to an {{ objstorage-name }} bucket. The bucket will be mounted to the `/mnt/gfs0` directory of the VMs in the instance group.
         * {% include [ssh-connection-internal-ip](../../../_includes/instance-groups/ssh-connection-internal-ip.md) %}

   - {{ TF }} {#tf}

      {% include [terraform-install](../../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

      1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of the resources you want to create:

         For more information about the resources you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}).

      1. Create resources:

         {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

         All the resources you need will then be created in the specified folder. You can check the new resources and their configuration using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

         {% include [ssh-connection-internal-ip](../../../_includes/instance-groups/ssh-connection-internal-ip.md) %}

   - API {#api}

      Use the [create](../../instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/create.md) REST API method for the [InstanceGroup](../../instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/index.md) resource or the [InstanceGroupService/Create](../../instancegroup/api-ref/grpc/InstanceGroup/create.md) gRPC API call.

   {% endlist %}

Make sure the bucket is connected to VMs in the instance group. To do so, [connect](../vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to a VM via SSH and navigate to the directory that you specified as the mount point.
