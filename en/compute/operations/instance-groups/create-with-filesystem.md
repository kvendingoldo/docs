# Creating an instance group connected to a file storage


One of the ways to handle [stateful workloads](../../concepts/instance-groups/stateful-workload.md) is saving the application state to a [file storage](../../concepts/filesystem.md) independent of the instance group.

To create an instance group that will automatically connect a common file storage to each of its instances:

1. {% include [sa.md](../../../_includes/instance-groups/sa.md) %}
1. If you do not have a file storage, [create one](../filesystem/create.md).
1. Create an instance group:

   {% list tabs group=instructions %}

   - CLI {#cli}

      {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

      {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

      1. View the description of the [CLI](../../../cli/) command to create an instance group:

         ```bash
         {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --help
         ```

      1. Check if there are any [networks](../../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network) in the [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder):

         ```bash
         yc vpc network list
         ```

         If there are none, [create a network](../../../vpc/operations/network-create.md).
      1. Select one of the {{ marketplace-full-name }} public images, e.g., [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS](/marketplace/products/yc/ubuntu-22-04-lts).

         {% include [standard-images.md](../../../_includes/standard-images.md) %}

      1. Prepare a file with the [YAML specification](../../concepts/instance-groups/specification.md) of the instance group and give it a name, e.g., `specification.yaml`.

         To connect the file storage to VMs in the instance group, add the following to the specification:

         * In the `instance_template` field, a nested `filesystem_specs` field containing the description of the file storage:

            ```yml
            instance_template:
              ...
              filesystem_specs:
                - mode: READ_WRITE
                  device_name: <VM_device_name>
                  filesystem_id: <file_storage_ID>
            ```

            Where:
            * `mode`: File storage access mode, which must be `READ_WRITE` for both reading and writing.
            * `device_name`: Device name for connecting the [file storage](../../concepts/filesystem.md) to the VM, e.g., `sample-fs`. The name may contain lowercase Latin letters, numbers, and hyphens. The first character must be a letter. The last character cannot be a hyphen. The name may be up to 63 characters long.
            * `filesystem_id`: ID of the file storage. You can view the ID in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or using the `yc compute filesystem list` CLI command.

         * In the `#cloud-config` section of the `instance_template.metadata.user-data` field, commands for mounting the file storage to the instance:

            ```yml
            instance_template:
              ...
              metadata:
                user-data: |-
                  #cloud-config
                  ...
                  runcmd:
                    - mkdir <VM_mount_point>
                    - mount -t virtiofs <VM_device_name> <VM_mount_point>
                    - echo "test-fs <VM_mount_point> virtiofs    rw    0   0" | tee -a /etc/fstab
            ```

            Where:
            * `<VM_mount_point>`: Directory on the VM to mount the connected file storage to, e.g., `/mnt/vfs0`.
            * `<VM_device_name>`: Device name for connecting the file storage to the VM. The value must match the one specified earlier in the `instance_template.filesystem_specs.device_name` field.

         YAML specification example:

         ```yml
         name: my-vm-group-with-fs

               - mkdir /mnt/vfs0
               - mount -t virtiofs sample-fs /mnt/vfs0
               - echo "sample-fs /mnt/vfs0 virtiofs    rw    0   0" | tee -a /etc/fstab

               - first
               - second
         ```

         This example shows a specification for [creating a fixed-size instance group](./create-fixed-group.md) with a file storage connected to the instances.

         For more information about the instance group specification parameters, see [{#T}](../../concepts/instance-groups/specification.md).

      1. Create an instance group in the default folder:

         ```bash
         {{ yc-compute-ig }} create --file specification.yaml
         ```

         This command creates a group of two similar instances with the following configuration:
         * Name: `my-vm-group-with-fs`.
         * OS: `Ubuntu 22.04 LTS`.
         * Availability zone: `{{ region-id }}-a`.
         * vCPUs: 2; RAM: 2 GB.
         * Network [HDD](../../concepts/disk.md#disks-types): 32 GB.
         * Connected to a file storage. The file storage will be mounted to the `/mnt/vfs0` directory of the VMS in the instance group.
         * {% include [ssh-connection-internal-ip](../../../_includes/instance-groups/ssh-connection-internal-ip.md) %}

   - {{ TF }} {#tf}

      {% include [terraform-install](../../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

      1. In the configuration file, describe the parameters of the resources you want to create:

            If you already have suitable resources, such as a service account, cloud network, and subnet, you do not need to describe them again. Use their names and IDs in the appropriate parameters.

            {% endnote %}

         For more information about the resources you can create with {{ TF }}, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-link }}).

      1. Create resources:

         {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

         All the resources you need will then be created in the specified folder. You can check the new resources and their configuration using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}).

         {% include [ssh-connection-internal-ip](../../../_includes/instance-groups/ssh-connection-internal-ip.md) %}

   - API {#api}

      Use the [create](../../instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/create.md) REST API method for the [InstanceGroup](../../instancegroup/api-ref/InstanceGroup/index.md) resource or the [InstanceGroupService/Create](../../instancegroup/api-ref/grpc/InstanceGroup/create.md) gRPC API call.

   {% endlist %}

Make sure the file storage is connected to VMs in the instance group. To do so, [connect](../vm-connect/ssh.md#vm-connect) to a VM via SSH and navigate to the directory that you specified as the mount point.
