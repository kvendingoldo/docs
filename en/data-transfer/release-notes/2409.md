# {{ data-transfer-name }} release notes: September 2024

## New features {#new-features}


1. Added the ability to specify a {{ connection-manager-name }} connection ID to configure [{{ mpg-short-name }}](../operations/endpoint/source/postgresql.md) endpoint authorization.


1. Added support for the `tombstones.on.delete` setting in the [Debezium serializer](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/stable/transformations/applying-transformations-selectively.html#ignoring-tombstone-events).

1. Added support for [shard groups](../../managed-clickhouse/operations/shard-groups.md) in [{{ CH }}](../operations/endpoint/source/clickhouse.md) endpoints. 

## Fixed issues {#problems-solved}

1. In {{ PG }}, fixed the issue of duplicate data during the `UPDATE` replication in tables without a primary key.

1. Improved activation error messages: now they display the actual error instead of `context canceled`.

1. Improved the behavior of data transfers to a [{{ CH }} target](../operations/endpoint/target/clickhouse.md) for cases when a table is not available on some of the hosts in a single shard.
