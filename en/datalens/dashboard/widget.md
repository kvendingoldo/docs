## Chart {#chart}

You can place charts anywhere on the dashboard and resize the dashboard.
Charts can be linked to selectors.

## Selector {#selector}

A filter that affects query results on its linked widgets. To add a selector to a dashboard, go to [{#T}](../operations/dashboard/add-selector.md).
A selector can be linked to a chart or another selector. For more information, see [{#T}](./link.md).
