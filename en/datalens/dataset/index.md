# Dataset in {{ datalens-name }}

A _dataset_ describes a set of data and its structure. Data in a dataset is represented as fields.

{{ datalens-short-name }} creates a dataset based on a data source for which there is a [connection](../concepts/connection.md).


A dataset works with sources in direct access mode: {{ datalens-short-name }} runs all data queries on the source side.
