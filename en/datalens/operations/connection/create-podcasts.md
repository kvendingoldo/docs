# Creating a Yandex Music podcast connection

 Only users with permissions for a Yandex Music podcast can create connections and process podcast analytics. If you do not have access to any podcast, no data will be displayed on the dashboard.
 
 You will get access after uploading a podcast to Yandex Music. The podcast is linked to the Yandex email address you specified when uploading it.

1. (Optional) Make sure the connection works properly. To do this, click **Check connection**.
1. Click **Create connection**.
1. Select a [workbook](../../workbooks-collections/index.md) to save your connection to or create a new one. If using legacy folder navigation, select a folder to save the connection to. Click **Create**.
