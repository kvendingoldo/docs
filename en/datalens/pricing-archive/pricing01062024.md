{% note warning %}

This is the old version of the pricing policy that expired on June 1, 2024. To learn more about the current {{ datalens-full-name }} pricing policy, see the [{{ datalens-name }} pricing policy](../pricing.md).

{{ datalens-full-name }} features service plans offering different service packages:

* **Community**: Suitable for small teams and non-profit projects.
* **Business**: Suitable for enterprise deployments and business scenarios.

The plan you choose covers your organization and can only be [changed](../settings/service-plan.md#change-service-plan) by its owner or administrator.

From April 23 through June 1, 2024, you will be able to test the features offered by these service plans at no charge. This will help you choose a plan that best fits your needs. After that period, we will start charging for the service plans.
