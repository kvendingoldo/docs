# {{ datalens-short-name }} roles

There are two types of roles in {{ datalens-short-name }}:

* For service access: These roles are assigned for an [organization](../concepts/organizations.md) and grant access to {{ datalens-short-name }}.
* For [workbooks and collections](../workbooks-collections/index.md): These roles define the access level to each workbook or collection. They apply to users who [switched to workbooks and collections](../workbooks-collections/index.md#enable-workbooks) to store their objects in {{ datalens-short-name }}.

## Roles required to access the service {#service-roles}

To grant a user access to {{ datalens-short-name }}, [assign](../../organization/security/index.md#add-role) them a role. You can assign roles to a Yandex account, a [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), [federated users](../../iam/concepts/federations.md), a [user group](../../organization/operations/manage-groups.md), or a [system group](../../iam/concepts/access-control/system-group.md).


{% list tabs %}

- Before switching to workbooks and collections

   {% include [datalens-instances-user](../../_includes/roles-datalens-user.md) %}

{% endlist %}



## Roles for workbooks and collections {#workbooks-collections-roles}

These roles apply to users who switched to a new approach to storing {{ datalens-short-name }} objects: in [workbooks and collections](../workbooks-collections/index.md). The roles allow you to define the level of access to each workbook or collection for a user or a user group.
