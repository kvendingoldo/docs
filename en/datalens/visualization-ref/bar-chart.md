# Bar chart ![](../../_assets/datalens/horizontal-bar.svg)

This chart displays the values of one or more measures by each category, using horizontal bars. The length of a bar determines the measure value: the longer the bar, the larger the value. For example, you can compare sales of products by their subcategory.

## Types of bar charts {#types}

* [Grouped](#groupped)
* [Stacked](#stacked)

### Grouped {#groupped}

A chart with grouping by dimension lets you compare two or more categories by a single measure. For example, grouping by delivery type allows you to compare the cost of products delivered by courier and picked up. Categories are highlighted in different colors and the length of the bar indicates the measure value.

Subcategory |	Delivery |	Pickup
-------------|---------| ----------|
Beauty and health products |	12К |	32К
Kitchenware |	394К |	998К
Kitchen products |	371К |	749К
Detergents |	127К |	278К
Health and beauty equipment |	497К |	1,263К
Non-essential goods |	268К |	560К

{% endcut %}

Use a chart with grouping to compare two or more measures, such as the number of orders and the number of products. The bar length corresponds to the measure value.

Health and beauty equipment |	863 |	2,705
Non-essential goods |	705 |	2,152
Cleaners |	770 |	2,460

{% endcut %}

### Stacked {#stacked}

A stacked chart shows a ratio of internal segments to the total value. Segments are placed one after another: the beginning of each subsequent segment is the outermost boundary of the previous one.
This type of chart is used to see the contribution of each measure to the total value by period or category. For example, to view the percentage of different expenses in the total budget amount.

## Wizard sections {#wizard-sections}

Wizard<br/> section| Description
----- | ----
Y | Dimensions. You can specify one or two dimensions.
X | Measure. You can specify multiple measures. If you add more than one measure to a section, the **Colors** section will contain a dimension named [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md). You can move [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) to the Y axis.
Colors | [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) dimension or field. Affects the column color. To delete [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md), click the cross icon or remove measures from the X axis.
Sorting | Dimension or measure. Affects the column sorting. The sorting direction is marked with an icon next to the field: ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/bars-ascending-align-left.svg) for ascending or ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/bars-descending-align-left.svg) for descending. To change the sorting direction, click the icon.
Labels | Measure. Displays measure values on the chart. If multiple measures are added to the **Y** section, drag [Measure Values](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) to this section. [Markup functions](../function-ref/markup-functions.md) are supported. For `String` type fields, you can configure using basic [{#T}](../dashboard/markdown.md) syntax: click the icon before the field name and enable **Markdown**.
Filters | Dimension or measure. Used as a filter.

## Creating a bar chart {#create-diagram}

To create a bar chart:


{% include [datalens-workbooks-collections-note](../../_includes/datalens/operations/datalens-workbooks-collections-note-step4.md) %}


1. Go to the {{ datalens-short-name }} [home page]({{ link-datalens-main }}).
1. In the left-hand panel, select ![chart](../../_assets/console-icons/chart-column.svg) **Charts**.
1. Click **Create chart** → **Chart**.
1. At the top left, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/circles-intersection.svg) **Select dataset** and specify the dataset to visualize.
1. Select **Line chart** as the chart type.
1. Drag one or more dimensions from the dataset to the **Y** section. The values will be displayed on the Y axis.
1. Drag one or more measures from the dataset to the **X** section.
1. Drag a dimension from the dataset or the [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) field to the **Color** section.

A stacked column chart is displayed by default.

### Creating a grouped bar chart {#grouped-bar-chart}

To display an Y-axis grouped bar chart:

1. Go to the bar chart that you created.
1. Depending on the number of measures in the **X** section, follow these steps:
    
   {% list tabs group=indicators_number %}
    
   - Single measure {#one}
       
     1. Check if there is a dimension in the **Colors** section.
     1. Duplicate this dimension in the **Y** section. The sequence of dimensions affects the grouping order.
    
   - Two or more measures {#more}
    
     1. Drag the [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) dimension to the **Colors** section.
     1. Drag the [Measure Names](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) dimension to the **Y** section. The sequence of dimensions affects the grouping order.

   {% endlist %}

### Adding a column color based on a measure {#column-colors}

To color columns in a chart based on the value of a measure:

1. Go to the column chart that you created.
1. Depending on the number of measures in the **X** section, follow the steps below:

   {% list tabs group=indicators_number %}

    - Single measure {#one}

      Copy the measure from the **X** section to the **Colors** section.

      Columns in the chart will take on colors as a function of the measure values.

      ![image](../../_assets/datalens/operations/chart/bar-colors-1.png)

    - Two or more measures {#more}

      Drag the [Measure Values](../concepts/chart/measure-values.md) measure to the **Colors** section.

      The chart columns will be colored based on the values of all measures listed in section **X**.

      ![image](../../_assets/datalens/operations/chart/bar-colors-2.png)

   {% endlist %}

1. Configure a color gradient for the measure as well. To do this, in the top-right corner of the **Colors** section, click ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/gear.svg) (the icon appears when you hover over the section).
1. In the color settings, specify:

   * **Gradient type**: Select two or three colors.
   * Gradient color: Select a color palette for the gradient from the list.
   * Gradient direction: Change the gradient direction using the ![image](../../_assets/console-icons/arrow-right-arrow-left.svg) icon.
   * **Set threshold values**: Set numeric thresholds for each color. Works if the **X** section contains a single value.

### Configuring display of `null` values {#null-settings}

{% include [datalens-chart-null-settings](../../_includes/datalens/datalens-chart-null-settings.md) %}

## Recommendations {#recomendations}

* {% include [category-text](../../_includes/datalens/datalens-category-text.md) %}
* Place segments inside bars so that the largest or most important categories are located to the left, closer to the chart's Y-axis. This makes it easier to compare the values.
* When visualizing multiple measures, select colors carefully. They should be distinguishable and contrasting. We recommend using no more than 3-5 colors per chart. If you want to emphasize one certain measure above the others, highlight it in some bright color.
