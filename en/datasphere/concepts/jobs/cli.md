# {{ ds-cli }}

You run {{ ds-jobs }} jobs using the {{ ds-cli }} utility.

To install {{ ds-cli }}, in a [Python virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/venv.html), run the following command:

```python
pip install datasphere
```

As soon as the installation is complete, you can view help by running this command with the `-h` flag:

```bash
datasphere -h
```

Command result:

```bash
usage: datasphere [-h] [-t TOKEN] [-l {ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}] [--log-config LOG_CONFIG] {version,project} ...

positional arguments:
  {version,project}
    version             Show version

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TOKEN, --token TOKEN
                        YC OAuth token, see https://yandex.cloud/en/docs/iam/concepts/authorization/oauth-token
  -l {ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}, --log-level {ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG}
                        Logging level
  --log-config LOG_CONFIG
                        Custom logging config
```

## {{ ds-cli }} commands {#commands}

You can manage jobs using the `datasphere project job` section commands:
* [Running](#execute) and restoring a job session.
* [Viewing](#list) job information.
* [Canceling](#cancel) a job.

### Running jobs {#execute}

To run the job, run the following command:

```bash
datasphere project job execute -p <project_ID> -c <configuration_file>
```

Where:

* `<project_ID>`:Â ID of the {{ ml-platform-name }} project you will run the job in.
* `<configuration_file>`: Path to the [job configuration file](index.md#config).

Running a job locks the shell session until the job completes. The job code operation [logs](#logs) will be output to the standard `stdout` output and `stderr` error streams. The job execution system logs will be written to a separate file in the user's working directory.

If the shell session is interrupted during job execution, the job will continue to run in {{ ml-platform-name }}, but the execution logs will not be saved. To resume logging, recover the session by running the following command:

```bash
datasphere project job attach --id <job_ID>
```

You can find out the job ID in the jobs widget of the {{ ml-platform-name }} UI on the project page.

Tracking and logging will resume after the job session is restored.

### Viewing job information {#list}

You can view all past and current project jobs by running the following command:

```bash
datasphere project job list -p <project_ID>
```

The response will return a table with the following fields:

* Job ID.
* Name.
* Description.
* Status.
* Job start and end date (if already completed).
* Name of the user who ran the job.

To view information about a specific job, run the following command:

```bash
datasphere project job get --id <job_ID>
```

### Canceling a job {#cancel}

You can stop and cancel a job in two ways:

1. If you have a shell session running with a job in progress, click **Ctrl** + **C**.
1. If you want to stop a job that is not related with an active shell session, run the following command:

   ```bash
   datasphere project job cancel --id <job_ID>
   ```

The running job will be stopped.

## Job logs {#logs}

When running a job through {{ ds-cli }}, the shell first notifies the user to save the logs in the user's working directory. For example:

```bash
2024-05-16 12:42:35,447 - [INFO] - logs file path: C:\Temp\datasphere\job_2024-05-16T12-42-35.427056
```

After running the job, you can find the following files in the user's working directory:

* `stdout.txt`: Standard output stream of the user program.
* `stderr.txt`: Standard error message stream.
* `system.log`: System log of the VM configuration and environment package installation.
* `log.txt`: General {{ ds-cli }} log which records the progress of the job.
* `docker_stats.tsv`: Log of the resources consumed by the [Docker image](../docker.md), such as utilized CPU power, read and write speeds, used RAM, and boot speed. You can also get this information by running the `docker stats` [command](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/stats/).
* `gpu_stats.tsv`: Log of GPU utilization, which includes the number of cores, utilized power, and video memory.

To change the directory for storing logs, use the following command:

```bash
datasphere --log-dir <new_directory>
```
