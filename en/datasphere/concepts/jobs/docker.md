# Docker images in jobs

By default, {{ ds-jobs }} [jobs](./index.md) use the `nvidia/cuda:11.8.0-cudnn8-runtime-ubuntu22.04` public image with a pre-installed Conda package manager, Python 3.10, and other additional packages. This image is stored in the {{ ml-platform-name }} cache, so using the default environment allows you to run your jobs faster.

You can also use a different Docker image to run jobs by specifying it under `env` in the job configuration file. This can be:

* {{ ml-platform-name }} system image

  ```text
  env:
    docker: system-python-3-10   # Python 3.10 system image
  ```

* Custom Docker image available in the job project

  ```text
  env:
    docker: <Docker_image_ID>  # ID expressed as b1gxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  ```

  {% note warning %}

  When using a project Docker image, the job runtime environment will not include libraries installed in the notebook.

  {% endnote %}

* External image

  You can use any preferred image registry ([{{ container-registry-full-name }}](https://yandex.cloud/en/services/container-registry), [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/), [Docker â€” Private Registries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/docker-private-registries/), etc.) by specifying the username and password to access the image.

  ```text
  env:
    docker:
      image: <image_path>
      username: <username>
      password:
        secret-id: <project_secret_ID>
  ```

  Where:

  * `<image_path>`: Full path to the image in a container registry, e.g., `{{ registry }}/b1g**********/myenv:0.1`.
  * `<username>`: Username for accessing your registry. For {{ container-registry-full-name }} authentication, use a [service account](../../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) and an [authorized key](../../../iam/concepts/authorization/key.md).
  * `<project_secret_ID>`: ID of the secret with a password. The secret must be [created](../../operations/data/secrets.md#create) in a {{ ml-platform-name }} project.

  If you are using a public image, you do not need to specify authentication credentials:

  ```text
  env:
    docker:
      image: ubuntu:focal
  ```
