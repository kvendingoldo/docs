# Exporting a project

You can export a project as a ZIP archive. In this case, both the file with a notebook and all files that you see in the **File Explorer** window will be exported. This allows you to start your notebook locally as long as you have matching environments.

## Getting started {#before-begin}

{% include [include](../../../_includes/datasphere/ui-before-begin.md) %}

## Exporting a project {#export-project}

Make sure you've saved the changes. The last saved state is exported.

1. In the top panel, click **File** and select **Export project as zip**.
1. In the window that opens, click **Download**.

    Wait for the ZIP archive with the project to download.
