# Viewing zone metrics

{{ dns-name }} automatically sends zone and request metrics to [{{ monitoring-full-name }}](../../monitoring).

You can view the general operational statistics on the [zone page](#storage-ui) or detailed statistics in the [{{ monitoring-name }} interface](#monitoring).

For a full list of metrics, see the [reference](../metrics.md).
