# How to choose a version of {{ forms-full-name }}


You can use {{ forms-full-name }} in personal matters, for example, to conduct a survey for your friends and make a menu for a New Year's party. You can also use forms for business, such as to accept orders for your online store.

- To createÂ a [personal form](personal-forms.md) go to the [{{ link-forms-admin }}]({{ link-forms-admin }}) page and [log in to your Yandex account]({{ link-passport }}).

- To create a [form for business](forms-for-org.md), go to the [{{ link-forms-b2b }}]({{ link-forms-b2b }}) page and [log in using the organization's employee account](login.md).

To switch between personal forms and forms for business, click **To personal forms** or **To forms for business** at the top right of the page in {{ forms-full-name }}.
