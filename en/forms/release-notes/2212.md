# {{ forms-full-name }} release notes: December 2022

* [Specifying error types when integrating with {{ wiki-full-name }}](#errors-wiki-integration)
* [Optimizing the answer with response options from a {{ wiki-full-name }} dynamic table](#wiki-suggest)

## Specifying error types when integrating with {{ wiki-full-name }} {#errors-wiki-integration}

In case of an error when [integrating with {{ wiki-full-name }}](../send-wiki.md), the service will point you to the issue:
* The specified page does not exist.
* The <q>{{ wiki-name }} robot</q> (`yndx-wiki-cnt-robot`) service account does not have access to the page.

## Optimizing the answer with response options from a {{ wiki-full-name }} dynamic table {#wiki-suggest}

For a [<q>Wiki</q>](../blocks-ref/wiki.md) question, you can set up answer options that are loaded from a [{{ wiki-name }} dynamic table](../../wiki/create-grid.md). The user no longer needs to start typing the answer option, as the first 10 possible options will be displayed automatically when the cursor is in the input field.
