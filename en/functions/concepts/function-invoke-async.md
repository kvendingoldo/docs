# Asynchronous function invocation

{% include [note-preview](../../_includes/note-preview.md) %}

When you create a new function version, you can set up asynchronous invocation to invoke the function without waiting for it to complete.

To invoke a function asynchronously, specify the `?integration=async` request string parameter. When invoked this way, a function cannot parse or set HTTP headers:
* The contents of the HTTPS request body are provided as the first argument (without converting to a JSON structure).
* The contents of the HTTPS response body is identical to the function response (without converting or checking the structure) and the HTTP response status is `202`.

You have the option to either ignore the function's output or send it to {{ message-queue-full-name }}.
