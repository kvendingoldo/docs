# Cookie

{{ yandex-cloud }} web interfaces use `yc_session` cookies to authenticate a user.

In the console of each service (e.g., [https://{{ console-host }}]({{ console-host }}) and [{{ link-org-main }}]({{ link-org-main }})), cookies are independent of each other.

All cookies are linked to a single logical session initiated by [{{ auth-main-host }}]({{ auth-main-host }}).
