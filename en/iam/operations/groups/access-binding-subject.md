# Granting permissions to a user group

To grant access permissions to a [user group](../../../organization/concepts/groups.md), give it roles for the resources from the [list](../../concepts/access-control/resources-with-access-control.md). You can also permit [subjects](../../concepts/access-control/index.md#subject) to [access a group](access-binding-object.md) as a resource.
