# Digitally signing files and artifacts using Cosign

You can use digital signature key pairs created with the [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/signing/quickstart/) utility in {{ kms-name }}. A special build of Cosign allows you to store the created key pair in {{ kms-short-name }}, sign files and artifacts with the pair's private key, and verify a digital signature using its public key.

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

1. Install a special Cosign build for your OS:

   {% include [install-cosign](../../_includes/kms/install-cosign.md) %}

1. Get an [IAM token](../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) and save it to the `$YC_IAM_TOKEN` environment variable:

   {% list tabs group=programming_language %}

   - Bash {#bash}

      ```bash
      export YC_IAM_TOKEN=$(yc iam create-token)
      ```

   - PowerShell {#powershell}

      ```powershell
      $env:YC_IAM_TOKEN = $(yc iam create-token)
      ```

   {% endlist %}

## Sign a local file {#create-signature}

1. Create a digital signature key pair and save it to {{ kms-short-name }}:

   ```bash
   cosign generate-key-pair \
       --kms yckms:///folder/<folder_ID>/keyname/<key_pair_name>
   ```

   Where:
   * `<folder_ID>`: [ID of the folder](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) where the new key pair will be saved.
   * `<key_pair_name>`: Name of the signature key pair you create.

   Result:

   ```bash
   client.go:183: Using IAM Token from 'YC_IAM_TOKEN' environment variable as credentials
   client.go:310: generated yckms KEY_ID: 'abj15qhhh98d********'
   Public key written to cosign.pub
   ```

   The utility will return the ID of the created signature key pair and save a public signature key to a local file. Save the key pair ID, you will need it in the next steps.

   You can always get the ID of your signature key pair in the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or using the appropriate [CLI](../../cli/cli-ref/managed-services/kms/asymmetric-signature-key/list.md) command.

1. Sign a local file:

   ```bash
   cosign sign-blob \
       --key yckms:///<key_pair_ID> \
       --tlog-upload=false \
       <path_to_file>
   ```

   Where:
   * `<key_pair_ID>`: ID of the signature key pair obtained in the previous step.
   * `<path_to_file>`: Path to the local file you want to sign.

   Result:

   ```bash
   Using payload from: <path_to_file>
   client.go:183: Using IAM Token from 'YC_IAM_TOKEN' environment variable as credentials
   <digital_signature_value>
   ```

   Save the resulting digital signature value. You will need it for signature verification in the next step.

## Verify the digital signature {#verify-signature}

To verify the signature, run the following command:

```bash
cosign verify-blob \
    --key yckms:///<key_pair_ID> \
    --insecure-ignore-tlog \
    --signature "<digital_signature_value>" \
    <path_to_file>
```

Where:
* `--key`: Signature key pair ID obtained earlier.
* `--signature`: Digital signature value obtained in the previous step.
* `<path_to_file>`: Path to the local file whose signature you want to verify.

Result:

```bash
WARNING: Skipping tlog verification is an insecure practice that lacks of transparency and auditability verification for the blob.
client.go:183: Using IAM Token from 'YC_IAM_TOKEN' environment variable as credentials
Verified OK
```
