# Uploading DAG files to a {{ maf-name }} cluster

Automation, data processing, and scheduled task execution are implemented using _[DAG files](../concepts/index.md#about-the-service)_. DAG files are Python 3.8 scripts run inside {{ AF }}. For a DAG file example, see the [{{ AF }} documentation](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/tutorial/fundamentals.html).

DAG files are uploaded to the [{{ objstorage-full-name }} bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) specified when creating the cluster. This automatically delivers DAG task graphs into a {{ maf-name }} cluster and makes them appear in the {{ AF }} web interface.

To upload DAG files into a cluster:

1. [Grant](../../storage/operations/buckets/edit-acl.md) to the service account a `READ` permission for the bucket. Use the service account and bucket you specified when creating the cluster.
1. Create a folder, e.g., `dags`, in the bucket and [upload a DAG file to it](../../storage/operations/objects/upload.md#simple). This will upload DAG into the cluster.

   You can upload your DAG file to the bucket root, but it uploads quicker to a folder.

   If uploading additional scripts or modules used in DAG to this folder, specify the full path to these scripts or modules in the bucket. For example, you have uploaded all the files to the `dags` folder. If so, specify the following in the `from ... import` section of the DAG file:

   ```python
   from dags.<file_name> import <object>
   ```

1. [Open the {{ AF }} web interface](af-interfaces.md#web-gui).
1. Make sure that the new DAG file has appeared in the **DAGs** section. It may take a few minutes to upload a DAG file from the bucket.
