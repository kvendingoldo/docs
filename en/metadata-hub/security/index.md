Roles for a resource can be assigned by users who have the `connection-manager.admin` role or one of the following roles for that resource:

{% include [roles-list](../../_includes/iam/roles-list.md) %}

## Which resources you can assign a role for {#resources}

You can assign a role for an [organization](../../organization/quickstart.md), [cloud](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#cloud), [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder), or [connection](../concepts/connection-manager.md). The roles assigned for organizations, clouds, or folders also apply to nested resources.

You can assign a role for a connection in the management console.

## Which roles exist in {{ metadata-hub-name }} {#roles-list}

You can use {{ metadata-hub-name }} roles (_service roles_) and {{ yandex-cloud }} roles (_primitive roles_) to manage access permissions.

### Service roles {#service-roles}

{{ yandex-cloud }} supports a separate list of roles for each service in {{ metadata-hub-name }}. For more information, see:

* [Roles to manage connections using {{ connection-manager-name }}](connection-manager-roles.md).
* [Roles to manage metadata in a {{ metastore-full-name }} cluster](metastore-roles.md).

### Primitive roles {#primitive-roles}

{% include [roles-primitive](../../_includes/roles-primitive.md) %}

{% include [primitive-roles-footnote](../../_includes/primitive-roles-footnote.md) %}
