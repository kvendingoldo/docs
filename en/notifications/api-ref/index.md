# {{ cns-full-name }} HTTP API overview

The {{ cns-name }} HTTP API is compatible with the [Amazon SNS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/welcome.html).

You can use the [AWS CLI](../tools/aws-cli.md) and [AWS SDK for Python (boto3)](../tools/sdk-python.md) for more convenient work with the service.

For authentication in the API, CLI and SDK, use a [static access key](../../iam/concepts/authorization/access-key.md). A static access key is issued for the [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md), and all actions are performed on behalf of that service account.

{% note info %}

API requests to {{ cns-name }} with a static key must be signed using the [AWS Signature V4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-signing.html) algorithm.

{% endnote %}

To avoid signing API requests to {{ cns-name }}, you can use an [IAM token](../../iam/concepts/authorization/iam-token.md) instead of a static key. For more information, see [{#T}](send-request.md).

For a list of common error codes for all actions, see [{#T}](common-errors.md).
