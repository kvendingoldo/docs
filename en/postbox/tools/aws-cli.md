# AWS CLI

The [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/) is a command line interface designed for AWS services. To learn [how to run commands](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/index.html), see the official Amazon documentation.

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) a service account.
1. [Assign](../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa) the [roles](../security/index.md) required for your project to the service account. For more information about roles, see the [Identity and Access Management documentation](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles).
1. [Create](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md) static access keys. Save the ID and secret key to a secure location. You will not be able to view the secret key parameters again after you close the window.

## Installation {#installation}

{% include [install-aws-cli](../../_includes/aws-tools/install-aws-cli.md) %}

## Setup {#setup}

To configure the AWS CLI, run the `aws configure` command in your terminal. The command requests values for the following parameters:
1. `AWS Access Key ID`: ID of a static key created [when getting started](#before-you-begin).
1. `AWS Secret Access Key`: Contents of the static key.
1. `Default region name`: `{{ region-id }}` region.

   To work with {{ postbox-name }}, always specify `{{ region-id }}` as the region. A different region value may lead to an authorization error.

1. Leave the other parameter values unchanged.

### Configuration files {#config-files}

The `aws configure` command saves the static key and the region.

* The static key in the `.aws/credentials` file has the following format:

   ```ini
   [default]
     aws_access_key_id = <static_key_ID>
     aws_secret_access_key = <static_key_contents>
   ```

* The default region in the `.aws/config` file has the following format:

   ```ini
   [default]
     region = {{ region-id }}
   ```

* You can create multiple profiles for different service accounts by specifying their details in the `.aws/credentials` file:

   ```ini
   [default]
     aws_access_key_id = <ID_of_static_key_1>
     aws_secret_access_key = <contents_of_static_key_1>
   [<name_of_profile_2>]
     aws_access_key_id = <ID_of_static_key_2>
     aws_secret_access_key = <contents_of_static_key_2>
   ...
   [<name of_profile_n>]
     aws_access_key_id = <ID_of_static_key_n>
     aws_secret_access_key = <contents_of_static_key_n>
   ```

   Where `default` is the default profile.
