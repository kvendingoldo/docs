# Resource Manager API, REST: Cloud.Delete {#Delete}

Deletes the specified cloud.

## HTTP request

```
DELETE https://resource-manager.{{ api-host }}/resource-manager/v1/clouds/{cloudId}
```

## Path parameters

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| cloudId | **string**

Required field. ID of the cloud to delete.
To get the cloud ID, use a [CloudService.List](/docs/resource-manager/api-ref/Cloud/list#List) request. ||
|#

## Query parameters {#yandex.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.DeleteCloudRequest}

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| deleteAfter | **string** (date-time)

The timestamp after which the process of deleting the cloud should begin.
Until this timestamp, the cloud goes into the PENDING_DELETION state and all resources in this
cloud are stopped. In this state, it is possible to cancel the delete operation without any loss.
After this timestamp, the status of the cloud will become DELETING and the process of deleting
all the resources  of the cloud will be started. If `deleteAfter` is not specified it will be
(now + 24 hours). To initiate an immediate deletion `deleteAfter` must be <= now.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
[Protocol Buffers reference](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/overview).
In some languages, built-in datetime utilities do not support nanosecond precision (9 digits). ||
