## Specification example {#spec-example}

For the workflow covered by the YaWL specification below, execution is contingent upon input data (`input`).

Payload | Result
--- | ---
`{"final_action": "success"}` | `Success`
`{"final_action": "fail"}` | `fail now!` error
Other inputs | `code: STEP_NO_CHOICE_MATCHED, message: no condition is true, and there is no default` error
