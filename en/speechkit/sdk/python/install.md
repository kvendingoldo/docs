# Installing the Python SDK {{ speechkit-name }}

To use the [Python SDK](index.md), the `yandex-speechkit` package is required. Install it using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager:

```bash
pip install yandex-speechkit
```

The installation was tested on Python 3.9. For the minimum allowed Python version, see the [SDK website](https://pypi.org/project/yandex-speechkit/).

If a `grpcio-tools` package version conflict occurs during the installation, see [{#T}](version-conflict.md).
