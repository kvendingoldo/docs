# Synchronous audio recognition

Synchronous audio recognition ensures fast response times and is suitable for pre-recorded small single-channel audio fragments.

If you want to recognize speech over the same connection, use [streaming mode](streaming.md). In streaming mode, you can get intermediate recognition results.

## Audio requirements {#audio-requirements}

The audio you send must meet the following requirements:

* Maximum file size: {{ stt-short-fileSize }}
* Maximum length: {{ stt-short-audioLength }}
* Maximum number of audio channels: {{ stt-short-channelsCount }}

If your file is larger, longer, or has more audio channels, use [asynchronous recognition](transcribation.md).

{% include [audio-formats](../../_includes/speechkit/audio-formats.md) %}

For more information about each format's special features, see [Supported audio formats](../../speechkit/formats.md).
