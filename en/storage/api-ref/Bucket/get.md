A bucket resource.
For details about the concept, see [documentation](/docs/storage/concepts/bucket).

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| id | **string**

ID of the bucket. Always equal to `name`, which has priority. ||
|| name | **string**

Name of the bucket.

The name is unique within the platform. For naming limitations and rules, see
[documentation](/docs/storage/concepts/bucket#naming). ||
|| folderId | **string**

ID of the folder that the bucket belongs to. ||
|| anonymousAccessFlags | **[AnonymousAccessFlags](#yandex.cloud.storage.v1.AnonymousAccessFlags)**

Flags for configuring public (anonymous) access to the bucket's content and settings.
For details, see [documentation](/docs/storage/concepts/bucket#bucket-access). ||
|| defaultStorageClass | **string**

Default storage class for objects in the bucket. Supported classes are standard storage (`STANDARD`), cold storage
(`COLD`, `STANDARD_IA`, `NEARLINE` all synonyms), and ice storage (`ICE` and `GLACIER` are synonyms).
For details, see [documentation](/docs/storage/concepts/storage-class). ||
|| versioning | **enum** (Versioning)

Bucket versioning status.
For details, see [documentation](/docs/storage/concepts/versioning).

- `VERSIONING_UNSPECIFIED`
- `VERSIONING_DISABLED`: The bucket is unversioned, i.e. versioning has never been enabled for the bucket, including at its creation.
Objects that are stored in the bucket have a version ID of `null`.

  To enable versioning, change status to `VERSIONING_ENABLED` via a [BucketService.Update](/docs/storage/api-ref/Bucket/update#Update) request. Note that this
action is irreversible, and a bucket with versioning enabled can never return to `VERSIONING_DISABLED` state.
- `VERSIONING_ENABLED`: Bucket versioning is enabled, i.e. all new objects are versioned and given a unique version ID, and objects that
already existed at the time versioning was enabled will be versioned and given a unique version ID when modified
by future requests.

  To suspend versioning, change status to `VERSIONING_SUSPENDED` via a [BucketService.Update](/docs/storage/api-ref/Bucket/update#Update) request. You cannot
disable versioning altogether for a bucket that already had it enabled; objects that had version IDs will keep
them.
- `VERSIONING_SUSPENDED`: Bucket versioning is suspended, i.e. new objects are not versioned, but objects that already existed at the time
versioning was suspended are still versioned and keep their version IDs.

  To resume versioning, change status to `VERSIONING_ENABLED` via a [BucketService.Update](/docs/storage/api-ref/Bucket/update#Update) request. ||
|| maxSize | **string** (int64)

Maximum size of the bucket, in bytes.
For details, see [documentation](/docs/storage/operations/buckets/limit-max-volume). ||
|| policy | **object**

Bucket policies that set permissions for actions with the bucket, its objects, and groups of objects.
For details, see [documentation](/docs/storage/concepts/policy). ||
|| acl | **[ACL](#yandex.cloud.storage.v1.ACL)**

Access control list (ACL) of the bucket.
For details, see [documentation](/docs/storage/concepts/acl). ||
|| createdAt | **string** (date-time)

Creation timestamp.

String in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) text format. The range of possible values is from
`0001-01-01T00:00:00Z` to `9999-12-31T23:59:59.999999999Z`, i.e. from 0 to 9 digits for fractions of a second.

To work with values in this field, use the APIs described in the
