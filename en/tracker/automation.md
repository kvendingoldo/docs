# Automation and templates

{{ tracker-name }} has several features that let you automate your workflow and save time on recurring actions:

1. [Triggers](user/trigger.md): Automatic issue actions triggered by certain events. You can use triggers to update issue parameters, add comments, or execute HTTP requests.

1. [Auto actions](user/autoactions.md): Automatic recurring issue actions. Use auto actions for [automatic issue updates](user/create-autoaction.md) or [scheduled issue creation](user/ticket-schedule.md).

1. [Macros](manager/create-macroses.md): Automatic issue actions initiated by the user. You can use macros to update issue parameters or add standard comments.

1. [Templates](user/ticket-template.md) are boilerplates for standard tasks or comments.
