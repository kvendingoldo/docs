# Burndown charts

{% note warning %}

You can only use burn down charts on **Scrum** boards.

{% endnote %}

A burn down chart shows the issue completion rate and the remaining amount of work within a single [sprint](agile.md#dlen_sprint). Burn down charts are useful for evaluating whether the team will be able to solve the planned issues in time.

The chart's vertical axis shows the total workload left in [Story Points](agile.md#dlen_sp), while the horizontal axis shows time. An ideal burnout chart should be close to a straight line: it should start at a point with a maximum scope of work (the total of all the issues in the sprint) on day 1 of the sprint and end at zero on the last day of the sprint.

To view the chart:

1. Choose a board from the **Boards** menu in the top panel.

1. Go to the **Burn down chart** tab.

1. From the drop-down list, select the sprint whose issues you want to add to the chart.
