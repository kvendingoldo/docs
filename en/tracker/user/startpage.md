1. Need your response.

By editing or adding a new widget with issues, you can set up:
* Name: The header of the widget.
* Number of issues per page: if there are more issues, the widget will include multiple pictures, and you will see page navigation buttons at the bottom of the page.
* Filter: The filter used for creating the issue list. You can use the name of an existing filter or use the query language to create an expression.
* Columns: Issue parameters to be shown in the widget.

## How to set up a start page {#change-start-page}



As a home page, you can use any [filter](create-filter.md), [dashboard](dashboard.md), or [issue board](../manager/create-agile-board.md).If you do so, you can still access **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_page-my_PageMy.page-title }}** at the direct link: [https://tracker.yandex.ru/pages/my](https://tracker.yandex.ru/pages/my) or by clicking the home icon in the {{ tracker-name }} header.

For now, you can only change the home page in the old interface:
1. {% include [open-personal-settings](../../_includes/tracker/open-personal-settings.md) %}
1. Under **Start page**, choose the filter, dashboard, or issue board you want to see on the homepage.
1. Click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.save }}**.
