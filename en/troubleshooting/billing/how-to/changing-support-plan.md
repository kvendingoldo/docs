# How to change the technical support service plan


## Issue description {#case-description}

* You need to adjust your support service plan either by downgrading (for instance, from Business to Basic) or upgrading (for example, from Basic to Business).

## Solution {#case-resolution}

You can change the service plan on the [appropriate page in the “Support” section]({{ link-console-support }}).
Note that downgrading your support plan takes effect from the first day of the following month.

{% note info %}

Only the owner of the billing account (the `billing.accounts.owner` role) can change the support service plan.
If you do not see the option to change the service plan in the Support section, ask the user with the `billing.accounts.owner` role to change the plan for you.

{% endnote %}

## If nothing helped {#if-issue-still-persists}

If these actions did not help, [create a request for technical support]({{ link-console-support }}).
When creating the request, make sure to specify:

1. Billing account ID.
   You can find this ID on the [page with billing account details]({{ link-console-support }}).
2. Desired service plan.
3. Desired period of change to the specified support plan.
