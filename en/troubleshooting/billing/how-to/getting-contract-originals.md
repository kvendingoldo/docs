# How to get an original of the contract


## Scenario description {#case-description}

You need to obtain the original copy of your contract with Yandex Cloud, stamped and signed.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

The contract is presented as an offer agreement at this [link](https://yandex.ru/legal/cloud_oferta).

Stating the contract number when using the link or the printed version of the offer agreement fully matches the legal status of the signed service contract under Article 435 of the Russian Civil Code.

But if you still need the original contract copy, submit a request via the [form](https://cloud.yandex.ru/#contact-form).
A Yandex Cloud manager will contact you to discuss the signing terms. This process will take about two weeks.
