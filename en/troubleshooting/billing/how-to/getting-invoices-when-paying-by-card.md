# Receiving receipts for bank card payments


## Scenario description {#case-description}

You need to get a payment receipt after making a payment.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

The option to get a receipt depends on the country of residence of your billing account:

{% list tabs %}

- Residents of Russia or Kazakhstan

   In accordance with Federal Law-54 "On the Use of Cash Register Equipment", after paying for resources with a bank card, you receive a payment receipt by email.
   The address is listed on this [page]({{ link-console-settings }}) by the owner of the billing account.

   A payment receipt is a primary accounting document confirming the transfer of funds using a bank card.
   We recommend that you keep all your payment receipts, as this will help you if any problems with payments occur.

   The payment receipt amount is equal to the amount debited from the bank card linked to your account.

- Non-residents of Russia and Kazakhstan
