# How to get closing documents


## Scenario description {#case-description}

You need to receive closing documents (service provision report, account statement, invoice) for the last reporting period.

## Solution {#case-resolution}



You can also download the closing documents from the [Management console](../../../billing/operations/download-reporting-docs.md) after 5-7 days from the beginning of the next reporting period.

## If nothing helped {#if-issue-still-persists}

If the reporting documents for the previous reporting period have not arrived in your email 5-7 days after the start of the next reporting period, [create a request for technical support]({{ link-console-support }}).
Provide the following information in the request:

1. Billing account ID.
   You can find this ID on the [page with billing account details]({{ link-console-support }}).
2. List of the reporting documents you would like to receive.
