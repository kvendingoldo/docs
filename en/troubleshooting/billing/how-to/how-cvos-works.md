# How committed volume of services (CVoS) works


## Scenario description {#case-description}

You need to understand how the committed volume of services (CVoS) works.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

After enabling the committed volume of services (CVoS), the discount for using the services is applied automatically. You can view the usage in the usage details of products on your account. To find out how to view the usage details, see [here](../../../billing/operations/check-charges).

{% note info %}

You'll begin consuming the CVoS:
* Starting from the next hour, provided that the purchase is made effective from today
* From 00:00 MSK on the selected date, provided that the purchase is made effective from a date different from today

{% endnote %}

A detailed scheme of using and paying for CVoS is presented on this [page](../../../billing/concepts/cvos#how-to-pay).

Please keep in mind:
* If the actual volume is less than or equal to the CVoS, the amount is only charged pursuant to the agreement.
* If the actual volume exceeds the CVoS, the difference between the total volume and the CVoS is additionally charged at standard prices.
