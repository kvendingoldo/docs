# How to transfer funds between billing accounts


## Issue description {#case-description}

* You need to transfer funds from one billing account to another.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

You cannot transfer funds between billing accounts, but we can arrange a refund for you so you can top up the balance of the other billing account.
To refund the money, [create a request for technical support](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/support?section=contact).

Make sure to include in your request:

1. The ID of the billing account for which you are requesting a refund.
   You can find this ID on the [page with billing account details]({{ link-console-support }}).
2. The amount of funds to be refunded.

{% note info %}

The refund amount cannot exceed the current account balance.
