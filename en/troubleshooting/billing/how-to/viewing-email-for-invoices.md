# How to find out which email receives payment invoices


## Scenario description {#case-description}

You need to determine which email address the invoices are sent to.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

Use the [console](https://console.cloud.yandex.ru/settings%E2%80%9D) to check out where the invoices are being sent.

The invoice is only sent to the email address specified there. You cannot add an additional email address, but you can set up email forwarding to another address in your inbox: for more details, see [Yandex Mail Help](https://yandex.ru/support/mail/web/preferences/filters/forwarding.html).

## If the issue persists {#if-issue-still-persists}

If the invoice does not arrive at the email address linked to the billing account owner's account, [create a request for technical support]({{ link-console-support }}).
When creating the request, provide the following information:

1. The ID of the billing account for which you couldn't get an invoice.
   You can find it on the [page with billing account details]({{ link-console-billing }}).
2. The email address to which you expect the invoice to be delivered.
3. Description of the problem
