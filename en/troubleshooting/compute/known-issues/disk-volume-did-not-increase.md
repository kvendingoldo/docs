# Boot disk size failed to increase


## Issue description {#issue-description}

You increased the size of your boot disk, but it changed in the console rather than on the VM.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

If the partition on the boot disk failed to expand automatically after increasing the disk size, use these commands:

```
bash
sudo mount -o size=10M,rw,nodev,nosuid -t tmpfs tmpfs /tmp
sudo growpart /dev/vda 2
sudo resize2fs /dev/vda2
df -h
sudo umount /tmp
```
