# Troubleshooting the console connection error


## Issue description {#issue-description}

When trying to open the console through a web browser, the page does not open: an attempt to access the page ends with a timeout error.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

Try the following actions:

1. Temporarily disable IPv6 protocol support.
   You can make sure IPv6 is disabled using the commands:
* `ip addr | grep inet6` (for devices with an OS based on the Linux kernel)
* `netsh interface ipv6 show config` (for devices with Windows).  
   If you see an empty output as a result of its execution, it means that IPv6 has been successfully disabled.

2. Restart the device and reopen the [management console page]({{ link-console-main }}).


## If the issue persists {#if-issue-still-persists}

If the above actions did not help solve the problem, create a [request for technical support]({{ link-console-support }}).

When creating the request, provide the following information:

1. Name and version of the OS on your device.
2. Name and version of your browser: you can collect this information using this [site](https://whatmyuseragent.com/).
3. The result of executing these commands: `ping console.cloud.yandex.ru -c 10` and `ping -6 console.cloud.yandex.ru -c 10`.
4. The result of executing these commands: `mtr -rzbw console.cloud.yandex.ru --tcp -P 443 -c 100` and `mtr -6 -rzbw console.cloud.yandex.ru --tcp -P 443 -c 100`. U
