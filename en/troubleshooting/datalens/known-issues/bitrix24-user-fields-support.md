# Supporting custom Bitrix24 fields



## Issue description {#issue-description}

Some custom fields from Bitrix24 are not supported

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

The service does not support custom fields at the moment, but you can try to [add new calculated fields to the dataset](https://cloud.yandex.ru/docs/datalens/concepts/calculations/#dataset) created from a Bitrix24 connection.

Supported fields are listed [here](https://helpdesk.bitrix24.ru/open/16398726/).
