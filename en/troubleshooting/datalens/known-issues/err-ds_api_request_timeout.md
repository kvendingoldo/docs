# Resolving ERR.DS_API.REQUEST_TIMEOUT error


## Issue description {#issue-description}

* Building the chart ends with the `ERR.DS_API.REQUEST_TIMEOUT` error after a long wait.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

You cannot increase the data wait time threshold on the DataLens side. Try breaking up the most resource-consuming tasks into parts or use data filtering to reduce their number.

## If the issue persists {#if-issue-still-persists}
