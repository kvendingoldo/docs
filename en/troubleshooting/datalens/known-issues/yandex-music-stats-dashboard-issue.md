# Resolving issues with access to the podcast statistics dashboard in Yandex Music


## Issue description {#issue-description}

* You lost access to the podcast statistics dashboard in DataLens
* One or more podcasts fail to show up on the podcast statistics dashboard in DataLens.

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

Statistics in Yandex DataLens are updated once a day, so the dashboard charts may occasionally display data mismatching Yandex Music statistics.
Wait for a while (from one hour to a day), then check the dashboard charts data again.
