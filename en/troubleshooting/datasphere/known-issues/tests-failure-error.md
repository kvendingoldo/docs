# Resolving the "TestsFailure" error


## Issue description {#issue-description}

When building a Docker image, you see this error during testing:
```
TestsFailure:It is not possible to start the docker container for testing.
Make sure that the requirements from the documentation are satisfied.
```

## Solution {#issue-resolution}

Correctness tests ensure that the project operates properly on the Docker image. Possible errors:
1. The image is intended to launch a service (for example, a web application) rather than Jupyter.
2. The error occurs because there is no `jupyter` user in Docker. You can install it using this command:
```
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash --uid 1000 jupyter
```
