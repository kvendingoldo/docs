# Transferring DNS to another directory or cloud


## Issue description {#case-description}

You need to transfer DNS to another folder or cloud.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

You can transfer DNS by yourself. To accomplish this, you can export DNS zones to a Terraform manifest file and then deploy them in another cloud or folder using the YC CLI. We provide an example export command in our [documentation](https://cloud.yandex.ru/docs/cli/cli-ref/managed-services/dns/bind-file/migrate-to-terraform).
