# Setting up email notifications


## Issue description {#case-description}

You need to configure the contents of a notification to show arbitrary, rather than default, information.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

Some forms already contain email notifications. If the notification is missing, you can add it by clicking **Add action group** -> **Email**.

To change the notification contents, you need to:

1. Select the form and go to the **Integration** tab.
2. In the **Email** section, fill in the fields:
   — **To**:  The address where the notification will be sent. You can list several addresses separated by commas.
    — **Sender**: Sender's name
   — **Reply to**: Address inserted in the **To** field on **Reply** to the notification email.
   — **Subject**: Subject of the email
    — **Text**: Text of the email. To transmit responses to the form in the email, add the **Answers to questions** variable to this field.
3. Attach files to the email if needed.
4. Click the **Save** button.
