# Resolving the "RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED" error


## Issue description {#issue-description}

While working with Managed Service for YDB, you see the `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` error.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

Check the cluster monitoring charts for exceeding [quotas and limits of Managed Service for YDB](../../../ydb/concepts/limits.md).
For the database state monitoring charts of Managed Service for YDB:

1. Go to the page of your cloud folder and select **Managed Service for YDB**.
2. Click on the name of the required database and select the **Monitoring** tab.
3. To start working with metrics, dashboards, or alerts in Yandex Monitoring, click the **Open in Monitoring** button on the top panel.

On the page that opens, you will see the DB status charts.
If the `Requests per second` and `Request units per second` metrics on database monitoring charts often approach service limits, [increase the throughput](../../../ydb/operations/manage-databases#update-db-serverless) in the YDB cluster parameters.

{% note info %}

Increasing the throughput in the database settings might increase its operating expenses.

{% endnote %}

You can also create a [request to increase the quotas](https://console.cloud.yandex.com/cloud?section=quotas) of Managed Service for YDB from the management console.

## If the issue persists {#if-issue-still-persists}
