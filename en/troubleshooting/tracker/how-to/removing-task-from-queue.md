# How to remove a task from the queue


## Scenario description {#case-description}

You need to delete a task from a queue.

## Solution {#case-resolution}

You cannot delete a task you created: you can only transition it to a final status and set a resolution.

If tasks are causing clutter in your main queues, it makes sense to create a separate queue to serve as a bin, and move tasks from your main queues there. You can "recover" tasks from the bin queue whenever needed.

You can also hide tasks from statistics using tags.
