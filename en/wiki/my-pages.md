# Viewing a list of your pages

To view a list of pages that you created, go to **Created and edited**:

1. In the {{ wiki-name }} panel on the left, click ![](../_assets/wiki/svg/edited-icon.svg) **Created and edited**.

1. To the right of the **{{ ui-key.beta-wiki.blocks_common_favorites.blocks_b-favs-links.name_search }}** field, select **Created by me**.


## Inserting a list of all your pages to a page

Add the `not_var{{mypages}}` dynamic block to the text of your page created in the old editor.

You can use [additional block parameters](actions/page-lists.md#mypages) to sort the list and display lists of other users' pages.
