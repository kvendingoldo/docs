## {{ wiki-name }} page layout {#view}

You can add a cover to a page: this is a background that specifies the owner and name of the page and the date it was last updated.

To set the background, select ![](../../_assets/wiki/svg/add-cover.svg) **Add cover** in the actions menu. All {{ wiki-name }} users will see the cover.
