# Cloud CDN API, gRPC: OriginService.Update {#Update}

Updates the specified origin from the origin group.

Changes may take up to 15 minutes to apply. Afterwards, it is recommended to purge cache of the resources that
use the origin via a [CacheService.Purge](/docs/cdn/api-ref/grpc/Cache/purge#Purge) request.

## gRPC request

**rpc Update ([UpdateOriginRequest](#yandex.cloud.cdn.v1.UpdateOriginRequest)) returns ([operation.Operation](#yandex.cloud.operation.Operation))**

## UpdateOriginRequest {#yandex.cloud.cdn.v1.UpdateOriginRequest}
