# Compute Cloud API, REST: PlacementGroup.List {#List}

Retrieves the list of placement groups in the specified folder.

## HTTP request

```
GET https://compute.{{ api-host }}/compute/v1/placementGroups
```

## Query parameters {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.ListPlacementGroupsRequest}

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| folderId | **string**

Required field. ID of the folder to list placement groups in.

To get the folder ID make a [yandex.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.FolderService.List](/docs/resource-manager/api-ref/Folder/list#List) request. ||
|| pageSize | **string** (int64)

The maximum number of results per page to return. If the number of available
results is larger than `pageSize`,
the service returns a [ListPlacementGroupsResponse.nextPageToken](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.ListPlacementGroupsResponse)
that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests. ||
|| pageToken | **string**

Page token. To get the next page of results,
set `pageToken` to the [ListPlacementGroupsResponse.nextPageToken](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.ListPlacementGroupsResponse)
returned by a previous list request. ||
|| filter | **string**

A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.
The expression consists of one or more conditions united by `AND` operator: `<condition1> [AND <condition2> [<...> AND <conditionN>]]`.

Each condition has the form `<field> <operator> <value>`, where:
1. `<field>` is the field name. Currently you can use filtering only on the limited number of fields.
2. `<operator>` is a logical operator, one of `=`, `!=`, `IN`, `NOT IN`.
3. `<value>` represents a value.
String values should be written in double (`"`) or single (`'`) quotes. C-style escape sequences are supported (`\"` turns to `"`, `\'` to `'`, `\\` to backslash). ||
|| orderBy | **string**

By which column the listing should be ordered and in which direction,
format is "createdAt desc". "id asc" if omitted.
The default sorting order is ascending ||
