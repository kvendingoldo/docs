To get the folder ID use a [yandex.cloud.resourcemanager.v1.FolderService.List](/docs/resource-manager/api-ref/grpc/Folder/list#List) request. ||
|| diskId | **string**

Required field. ID of the disk to create the snapshot from.
To get the disk ID use a [yandex.cloud.compute.v1.DiskService.List](/docs/compute/api-ref/grpc/Disk/list#List) request. ||

or to the default values if the source does not define it. ||
|#

## HardwareGeneration {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.HardwareGeneration}

A set of features, specific to a particular Compute hardware generation.
They are not necessary supported by every host OS or distro, thus they are fixed to an image
and are applied to all instances created with it as their boot disk image.
These features significantly determine how the instance is created, thus cannot be changed after the fact.

||Field | Description ||
|| legacyFeatures | **[LegacyHardwareFeatures](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.LegacyHardwareFeatures)**

Includes only one of the fields `legacyFeatures`, `generation2Features`. ||
|| generation2Features | **[Generation2HardwareFeatures](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.Generation2HardwareFeatures)**

Includes only one of the fields `legacyFeatures`, `generation2Features`. ||
|#

## LegacyHardwareFeatures {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.LegacyHardwareFeatures}

Allows switching to PCI_TOPOLOGY_V2 and back.

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| pciTopology | enum **PCITopology**

- `PCI_TOPOLOGY_V1`
- `PCI_TOPOLOGY_V2` ||
|#

## Generation2HardwareFeatures {#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.Generation2HardwareFeatures}

A second hardware generation, which by default assumes PCI_TOPOLOGY_V2
and UEFI boot (with UEFI related features).

```

An Operation resource. For more information, see [Operation](/docs/api-design-guide/concepts/operation).

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| id | **string**

ID of the operation. ||
|| description | **string**

Description of the operation. 0-256 characters long. ||
|| createdAt | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**

Creation timestamp. ||
|| createdBy | **string**

ID of the user or service account who initiated the operation. ||
|| modifiedAt | **[google.protobuf.Timestamp](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#timestamp)**

The time when the Operation resource was last modified. ||
|| done | **bool**

If the value is `false`, it means the operation is still in progress.
If `true`, the operation is completed, and either `error` or `response` is available. ||
|| metadata | **[CreateSnapshotMetadata](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.CreateSnapshotMetadata)**

Service-specific metadata associated with the operation.
It typically contains the ID of the target resource that the operation is performed on.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any. ||
|| error | **[google.rpc.Status](https://cloud.google.com/tasks/docs/reference/rpc/google.rpc#status)**

The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||
|| response | **[Snapshot](#yandex.cloud.compute.v1.Snapshot)**

The normal response of the operation in case of success.
If the original method returns no data on success, such as Delete,
the response is [google.protobuf.Empty](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#google.protobuf.Empty).
If the original method is the standard Create/Update,
the response should be the target resource of the operation.
Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the response type, if any.

Includes only one of the fields `error`, `response`.

The operation result.
If `done == false` and there was no failure detected, neither `error` nor `response` is set.
If `done == false` and there was a failure detected, `error` is set.
If `done == true`, exactly one of `error` or `response` is set. ||

The correct license ID is generated by the platform. IDs are inherited by new resources created from this resource.

If you know the license IDs, specify them when you create the image.
For example, if you create a disk image using a third-party utility and load it into Object Storage, the license IDs will be lost.
You can specify them in the [yandex.cloud.compute.v1.ImageService.Create](/docs/compute/api-ref/grpc/Image/create#Create) request. ||
|| status | enum **Status**

Current status of the snapshot.
