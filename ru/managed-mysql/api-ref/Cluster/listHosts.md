# Managed Service for MySQL API, REST: Cluster.ListHosts {#ListHosts}

Retrieves a list of hosts for a cluster.

## HTTP request

```
GET https://{{ api-host-mdb }}/managed-mysql/v1/clusters/{clusterId}/hosts
```

## Path parameters

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| clusterId | **string**

Required field. ID of the cluster to list hosts for.

To get this ID, make a [ClusterService.List](/docs/managed-mysql/api-ref/Cluster/list#List) request. ||
|#

## Query parameters {#yandex.cloud.mdb.mysql.v1.ListClusterHostsRequest}

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| pageSize | **string** (int64)

The maximum number of results per page to return.

If the number of available results is larger than `pageSize`, the API returns a [ListClusterHostsResponse.nextPageToken](#yandex.cloud.mdb.mysql.v1.ListClusterHostsResponse) that can be used to get the next page of results in the subsequent [ClusterService.ListHosts](#ListHosts) requests. ||
|| pageToken | **string**

Page token that can be used to iterate through multiple pages of results.

To get the next page of results, set `pageToken` to the [ListClusterHostsResponse.nextPageToken](#yandex.cloud.mdb.mysql.v1.ListClusterHostsResponse) returned by the previous [ClusterService.ListHosts](#ListHosts) request. ||
|#

## Response {#yandex.cloud.mdb.mysql.v1.ListClusterHostsResponse}

**HTTP Code: 200 - OK**

#|
||Field | Description ||
|| hosts[] | **[Host](#yandex.cloud.mdb.mysql.v1.Host)**

List of hosts in the cluster. ||
|| nextPageToken | **string**

The token that can be used to get the next page of results.

If the number of results is larger than [ListClusterHostsRequest.pageSize](#yandex.cloud.mdb.mysql.v1.ListClusterHostsRequest), use the `nextPageToken` as the value for the [ListClusterHostsRequest.pageToken](#yandex.cloud.mdb.mysql.v1.ListClusterHostsRequest) in the subsequent [ClusterService.ListHosts](#ListHosts) request to iterate through multiple pages of results.

Each of the subsequent [ClusterService.ListHosts](#ListHosts) requests should use the `nextPageToken` value returned by the previous request to continue paging through the results. ||
