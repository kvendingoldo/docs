#|
||Field | Description ||
|| workflowId | **string**

Required field. ID of the Workflow. ||
|| pageSize | **string** (int64)

The maximum number of results per page that should be returned. If the number of available
results is larger than `pageSize`, the service returns a [ListExecutionsResponse.nextPageToken](#yandex.cloud.serverless.workflows.v1.ListExecutionsResponse)
that can be used to get the next page of results in subsequent list requests.

Default value: 100. ||
|| pageToken | **string**

Page token. To get the next page of results, set `pageToken` to the
[ListExecutionsResponse.nextPageToken](#yandex.cloud.serverless.workflows.v1.ListExecutionsResponse) returned by a previous list request. ||
|| filter | **string**

A filter expression that filters resources listed in the response.

The expression must specify:
1. The field name. Currently filtering can be applied to the following fields: status, started_at, finished_at.
2. Operator: `=`, `<` or `>`.
3. The value. Must be sting and match the regular expression `[+:\.-a-z0-9]`.
Examples of a filter: `status=ERROR`, `created_by=John.Doe`. ||

List of Workflow executions. ||
|| nextPageToken | **string**

Token for getting the next page of the list. If the number of results is greater than
